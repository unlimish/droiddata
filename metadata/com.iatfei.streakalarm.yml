Summary: Snapchat Streaks Reminder
Description: |-
    Reminds you to keep streaks by firing notification at user-defined intervals.
    Only works if you have friends.
    This is my first app project!

    Features:
    * Custom reminder interval from 1 to 11 hours
    * Notification stays until streaks are sent so you won't miss it
    * Mark streaks sent (also directly in notification)
    * Mark streaks sent some time earlier
    * Open Snapchat (also in notification)
    * Drop me an email if you have any suggestions!
