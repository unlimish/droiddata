Maintainer Notes:
If this app gets build, we have successfully tainted the build vm. It
requires a dependency that itself is opensource, but requires play-
services-appindexing. It does not actually get used, so most likely
it has been auto-added by AndroidStudio. Upstream issue:

Mark all AFs, force name, add big warning and publish only to archive
to make this absolutely clear: DO NOT INSTALL.
