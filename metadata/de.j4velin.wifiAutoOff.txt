Auto Name:WiFi Auto-Off
Summary:Turn off WiFi automatically
Description:
This simple Android app can help you increase the standby time of your device;
it automatically disables your WiFi radio when you don't need it and thereby
lowers the battery consumption. It is designed to be used with WiFi-only
tablets - these devices normally don't require a constant internet connection
if you're not using them and turning WiFi off can save a lot of battery power.

You can also specify to automatically turn on WiFi again, if you turn on your
device. This way, you are always connected to your WiFi network when using the
the tablet.

This app has a similiar effect like setting the "WiFi sleep policy" in Android
to "always", except that you can now exactly define the timeout between
turning the screen off and actually turning off WiFi.

If your device has a cell radio, it might switch to 2G/3G which may consume
more power than staying on WiFi.
