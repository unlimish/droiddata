AutoName: Badreads
Description: |-
    Badreads is a book tracking Android application for logging books
    you're reading, read, and want to read. Your library "shelves" (reading, read, and to read)
    are stored locally on your phone. Use the search or barcode reader to look up
    new book on OpenLibrary (https://openlibary.org) and add it to your library.
    You can import and export your library from or to Open Library and Goodreads.

    Badreads is unstable. I recommend backing up with an export before installing updates or changes.
