Auto Name:SwiFTP
Summary:FTP server
Description:
You need to access files on your phone, but you don't have a cable? This FTP
server allows remote access to files on your SD card (or any files on the
device, optionally, if you have root access). The author seems to have stopped
developing it but it should still work fine.
