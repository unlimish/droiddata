Auto Name:SwiFTP
Summary:FTP server
Description:
You need to access files on your phone, but you don't have a cable? This FTP server allows remote access
to files on your SD card (or any files on the device, optionally, if you have root access). The author
seems to have stopped developing it but it should still work fine.
