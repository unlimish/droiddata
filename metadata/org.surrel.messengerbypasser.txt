Auto Name:Messenger bypasser
Summary:Redirects "OpenFB Messenger" intents to the web chat
Description:
Bypasses the requirement for Messenger. In certain conditions, Facebook forces
the start of Messenger, which crashes the browser (i.e. Tinfoil for Facebook).
This app intercepts this start to prevent the crash and sends back the user to
the webapp.
