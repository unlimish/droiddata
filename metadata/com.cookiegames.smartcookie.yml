Description: |-
    ''Smart Cookie Secure Web Browser'' is a lightweight, basic and secure web
    browser that uses less than 8MB of space.

    There is an Incognito Mode which can be enabled and stops web trackers
    completely. As well as this, the user agent (your web "fingerprint") is the
    same as every other Smart Cookie user so websites canâ€™t track you.

    Smart Cookie is ad-free and always will be. There is also an ad blocker
    included which is enabled by default.
