Auto Name:Calendar Notifications Plus
Summary:Advanced calendar notifications
Description:
Replace calendar notifications with advanced notifications, allowing custom
snooze times and reboot notifications persistence. The app is focusing on making
its functionality as transparent as possible, notification would behave in the
same way as stock calendar notifications. All calendar applications should be
handled correctly in theory.
