Auto Name:IPFSDroid
Summary:IPFS Tool
Description:
This App does not represent a full IPFS node yet! Think of it as a dependency
injection for IPFS on android. Currently we use the centralized service ipfs.io
so you can use ipfs on android - later this will be exchanged for a full-node
for decentralisation but all things that use this app don't have to change/care.
