Auto Name:Hourglass
Summary:Set variable timers with audible alarm and vibration
Description:
A simple application that can be used to start a timer from one second to one
hour. The app can then be closed or left open, while a status bar notification
reminds you that you have a timer in progress.

Upon reaching 00:00, an audible bell as well as a short vibration and visual
pop-up will indicate that your timer has ended.

Great for reminding yourself to do something, or for use while playing games
that require timers!
