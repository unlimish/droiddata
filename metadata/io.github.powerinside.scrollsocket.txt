Auto Name:ScrollSocket
Summary:Scroll wirelessly using touchscreen
Description:
ScrollSocket sends mouse wheel events to the computer as you move your finger
over the android touchscreen. Requires a small driver to be running on the
computer.  See [http://powerinside.github.io/ScrollSocket/ website] for more
details on building the driver from source.

* Currently supports only linux with uninput kernel module.
* Horizontal scrolling not yet added.

This is a fork of the much awesome [[at.bitfire.gfxtablet]] app.
