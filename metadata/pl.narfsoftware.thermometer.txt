Auto Name:Thermometer Extended
Summary:Ambient conditions with charts
Description:
It displays additional information about various ambient conditions. You can
also choose to save data and examine it on a plot.

Features:

* Temperature
* Relative humidity
* Absolute humidity
* Pressure
* Dew point
* Light
* Magnetic field

Notice: When you are using Thermometer Extended in Save Data mode, chosen
sensors stay active, even if you close application. That may drain device
battery especially quickly, so always remember to stop saving data if you do not
need it. By default this option for all sensors is turned off.
