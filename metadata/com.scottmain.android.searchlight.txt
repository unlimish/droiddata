Auto Name:Search Light
Summary:LED Flashlight
Description:
Uses your camera's LED as a flashlight/torch. Also features a viewfinder using
the camera so you can see into tight spots that might be blocked by your phone
as you shine the light.

Try [[org.bc_bd.mrwhite]] if your device doesn't have a camera/flashlight.
