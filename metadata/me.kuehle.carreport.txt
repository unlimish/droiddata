Auto Name:Car Report
Summary:Track your car costs
Description:
Get an idea of how much your car costs. Simply enter the costs
after refueling and get nice reports.
These are:
# Fuel consumption
# Fuel price
# Average costs of the car per day, month and year

You can pinch-to-zoom in the graph and click on a point in
it so see its values. This app can manage
refuelings, other costs such as repairs and costs which occur
repeatedly such as taxes. You can use the
app with several cars concurrently.

'''N.B.''' Newer versions of this app (starting at 3.0) use the non-free
google play services library.
