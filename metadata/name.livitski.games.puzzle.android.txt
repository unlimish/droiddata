Summary:Classic puzzle game with custom images
Description:
n-Puzzle app is a classic sliding puzzle game based on the Fifteen Puzzle. It allows you to
choose among three levels of complexity: 3×3 (8-puzzle), 4×4 (15-puzzle), and 5×5
(24-puzzle), hence the name.

In addition to standard square boards with numbers, you can choose a board with a picture
painted on it. There are three stock pictures installed with the puzzle, and you can add your
own pictures by pressing Menu button when the picture selection page is displayed. The
picture you select will be split into equal tiles.
