Summary:Feeds audio from the phone's mic right out of its speaker
Description:
This microphone just feeds audio from the phoneâ€™s mic right out of its
speaker, which means you get a horrible screeching feedback noise.

However, plug the thing into your computer with a male to male headphone jack
and your phone becomes a PC mic.
