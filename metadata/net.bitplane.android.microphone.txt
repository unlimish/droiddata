Auto Name:Microphone
Summary:Feeds audio from the mic right out of the speaker
Description:
This microphone just feeds audio from the phone's mic right out of its speaker,
which means you get a horrible screeching feedback noise.

However, plug the thing into your computer with a male to male headphone jack
and your phone becomes a PC mic.
