Auto Name:Authorizer
Summary:Password Manager with USB Keyboard emulation
Description:
The idea behind Authorizer is, to use old smartphones as a hardware password
manager only. To avoid manual typing of long and complex passwords everytime you
need them, Authorizer pretends to be an USB keyboard (e.g. over an USB On-The-Go
adapter). With a button press inside the App, it will automatically enters the
password for you on your pc, laptop, tablet or main smartphone.
