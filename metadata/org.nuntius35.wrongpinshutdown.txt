Auto Name:Wrong PIN Shutdown
Summary:Shutdown device on wrong PIN
Description:
This simple app monitors the number of failed login attempts. If a certain
number of attempts is exceeded, the device is automatically shut down.

This app only works on a rooted device. You have to grant the app permanent
superuser privileges and register it as a device administrator. These steps are
automatically initiated on the first startup.
