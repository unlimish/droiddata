Name:Busybox Installer
Auto Name:BusyBox Free
Summary:System tools installer
Description:
Interface to install one version only of BusyBox (1.21.1) and its symlinks. For
now, the binary is only for ARM architecture as the others couldn't be built.

BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small
executable. It provides replacements for most of the utilities you usually find
in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. Android comes with a very limited multi-tool
called Toolbox and sometimes it is crippled even more, so a standard Busybox is
often needed by root apps that need to do different jobs. If you run a custom
ROM you probably have most of the applets that you would ever need, though this
binary has a few more.

The range of applets
[https://raw2.github.com/linusyang/android-busybox-ndk/master/android_ndk_stericson-like
available] isn't identical to the upstream version. Therefore, the applet
manager doesn't have information about all the installed applets.
.
