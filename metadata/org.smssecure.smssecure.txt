Auto Name:SMSSecure
Summary:Send encrypted text messages (SMS)
Description:
Communicatie with friends securely by encrypting your private text messages.
This is a fork of TextSecure, in which SMS encryption is not available anymore.

SMSSecure focuses on SMS. This fork aims to:

* Keep SMS encryption
* Drop Google services dependencies: push messages are not available in SMSSecure; if you want to keep them, SMSSecure is not for you.

If you want to migrate from TextSecure to SMSSecure:

* In TextSecure, export plaintext backup. Warning: the backup will not be encrypted.
* Rename TextSecurePlaintextBackup.xml to SMSSecurePlaintextBackup.xml.
* Install SMSSecure.
* In SMSSecure, import plaintext backup.
* Enjoy SMSSecure!
