Name: TalkBack (deprecated)
AutoName: TalkBack
Description: |-
  <b>NOTE:</b> This app is deprecated, you should use https://f-droid.org/packages/com.android.talkback instead.

  TalkBack is an Accessibility Service that helps blind and vision-impaired users
  interact with their devices more easily.

  This application adds spoken, audible, and vibration feedback to your device.

  It comes pre-installed on many devices so you won't be able to install this if
  that is the case.

  It's only activated if you explicitly turn on Accessibility:
  <ol>
  <li>Go to Settings</li>
  <li>Select Accessibility</li>
  <li>Enable TalkBack checkboxes</li>
  </ol>
