AutoName: Gift Card Guard
Description: |-
  The developer is currently on hiatus from the project. Questions and pull requests may not be looked at for some time.

  Manage gift cards, their current values, and an image of the most recent
  receipt. Never forget how much a gift card is worth, or be unable to use a gift
  card because the proof of its value is lost.
