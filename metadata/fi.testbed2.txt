Auto Name:Helsinki Testbed Viewer 2.0
Summary:Weather maps
Description:
With the application, you can, for example, view the real-time rain radar or 
current wind speed and direction. The maps cover the Southern Finland.

The data is copyright the 
[http://testbed.fmi.fi Helsinki Testbed Project] and the app has nothing to 
do with that project: it's only a client.

A proprietary ad library was removed.
