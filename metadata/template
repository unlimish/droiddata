Blank lines indicate a new paragraph and it is preferrable to make a new
line for a new sentence.
It is applicable to what would be the Recommended Version for most people 
i.e. the version that's closest to the Current Version (see below) and also
compatible with their device.

The description should be: 
* Fairly future proof, unless you intend to keep it updated 
* Not be too short 
* With a  maximum line length of 80 chars, unless the basic MediaWiki markup is used

The following extra are examples of items that may be helpful —

Requires root: No. The app can reboot the phone if it is allowed root.

Anti-features: 
* Tracking: The app uploads usage stats — see the Website for details
* Non-free Network Services: Calculations are done on the developers' server

Google Ad library was removed before building.

Supports x86 natively.

Status: Last version and/or BETA and/or current version can't be built.

Auto Update Mode:
# One of Tags, RepoManifest, Static, Market or None (in that order of preference)
