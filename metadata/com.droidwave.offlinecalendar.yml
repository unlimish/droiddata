AutoName: Offline Calendar
Summary: Calendar
Description: |-
    This calendar software can work completely without servers and independently.
    Offline Calendar can handle your Appointments, Tasks and Notes. It is a fork of
    Ancal with an easy to use graphical user interface. Like Ancal, future
    development is unlikely.
