Summary: Doom engine source port bundled with Freedoom 1 & 2
Description: |4-

    GZDoom is a feature centric port for all Doom
    engine games, based on ZDoom, adding an OpenGL
    renderer and powerful scripting capabilities.

    In addition to Doom, GZDoom supports Heretic,
    Hexen, Strife, Chex Quest, and other games
    based on the Doom engine.

    The Freedoom project aims to create a complete
    free content game based on the Doom engine.

    Combined with the engine, Freedoom is also
    compatible with game modifications (“mods”) made
    for the original Doom games, made by Doom fans
    and artists over the decades.

    Note: this is an unofficial port of GZDoom and
    FreeDoom to android and it's not affiliated with
    these projects.
