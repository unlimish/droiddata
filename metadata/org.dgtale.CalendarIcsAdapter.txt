Auto Name:Andoroid Calendar Event ics Import/Export
Summary:Calendar im/export of ics files
Description:
Android calendar event import/export via ics file/email-attachment/send.

'''Import to calendar:''' CalendarIcsAdapter allows you to import an event 
as the content of an ics-file or an ics-email-attachment into your android 
calendar. 

'''Send Event to...''' From the android calendar you can
send the currently selected event to any installed app that can receive text 
and/or attachments. If you choose your email client (i.e. k9mail) or 
bluetooth you can send the event data to somebodey elses computer and invite
him/her.

'''Required Android Permissions:''' 
* READ_CALENDAR used to export events from calendar
* WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE used to store the created ics-file so that it can be attached to email or send via bluetooth.

'''Status:''' Works with android 4.0 and up. Should work with android 2.1 and up
but it is not garanteed, since there was no standard calender api before android 4.0

This is a fork of icsimport. Current improvements: 
* implement export and 
* support for android prior to 4.0.
