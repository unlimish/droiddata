AutoName: Giant Stopwatch
Summary: Stopwatch and clock with giant digits
Description: |-
    Sports stopwatch with:

    <ul>
    <li>giant digits and adjustable theme (color, font, size, spacing, format)</li>
    <li>control with both on-screen buttons and volume buttons</li>
    <li>lap-timer</li>
    <li>delayed-start (with audio 3...2...1... countdown).</li>
    </ul>

    Free, small, no ads, open source (github.com/arpruss/simplestopwatch).

    As a bonus, includes a giant number clock (swipe to switch between clock and stopwatch).

    I made this so I could easily see the time while rock climbing at the gym 50 feet up. It's also useful poolside for swimming, and for other sports where you need to see the time from a distance (or close up, if you want).
