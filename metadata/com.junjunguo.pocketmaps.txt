Summary:View maps and use offline routing and navigation system
Description:
PocketMaps is a map viewer with navigation system.

Maps can be easily downloaded with this app. Thus, a complete offline navigation
is possible. Through the so-called geocoding places can be searched.

With the sport tracking feature, routes can be recorded to graph data such as
speeds.
