Summary:A two-player abstract strategy board game based on Isola game
Description:
Isolmoa is a two-player abstract strategy board game based on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isola_%28board_game%29 Isola] game.
It is played on a board which is initially filled with squares.
Both players have one piece.

To begin, each player places his/her piece.

Next, each turn of play is composed of two actions:

* moving his/her piece to a neighboring (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) position that contains a square but not the opponent's piece
* removing any square with no piece on it.

The goal of the game is to block the opponent by destroying all the squares which surround him before being blocked yourself.
