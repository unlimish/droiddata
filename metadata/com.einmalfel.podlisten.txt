Auto Name:PodListen
Summary:Podcast player with lightweight interface
Description:
Main idea behind this app is to set podcast listening free from inconvenience of
switching between screens and going through menus. Instead, all navigation in
PodListen is done by simply swiping between 3 tabs, basic actions are done with
single tap.

PodListen is open-source ad-free app, it doesn't include analytics services,
collect any user data or use strange system permissions.

Besides original interface, it has basic features one can expect from podcatcher
app:

* feeds refresh and episodes download
* OPML import and export
* subscription by clicking on RSS links in browser
* home screen widget
* playlist sorting modes
* preferences like “download on wi-fi only”

Podcast search feature is planned for an update.
