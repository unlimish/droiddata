Description: |-
    "NoSurf for reddit" is the world's first **non-addictive** Reddit client.

    Here's what it does:

    * Lets you browse ONLY the first page of /r/all,
    * Lets you browse ONLY the first page of your subscribed subreddits,
    * Lets you read ONLY the top 3 parent comments on each post,
    * Grays and X's out posts you've already read.

    ...and that's it. No more endless scrolling. No more brain hijacking. No
    more mindless surfing. No more finding yourself on page 89 of /r/all at
    3am.

    for reddit. Do it now.
