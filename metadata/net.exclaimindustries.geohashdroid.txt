Auto Name:Geohash Droid
Summary:Geohashing app
Description:
Geohash Droid can auto-detect your graticule, calculate the day's meetup point,
and follow you as you travel towards it.

Future features include tracking other people (at mutual discretion), storing a
history of meetup points found, and automatically marking pictures taken near
the point.

Oh, and achievement support. That's coming soonish.
