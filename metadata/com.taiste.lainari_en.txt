Name:Pocket Library
Summary:Assistance for library users
Description:
Pocket Library is a new kind of a service for library patrons.

The service expands the traditional notion of checking out materials, making it 
possible for library users to check out books and other items directly from 
other users anywhere.

To be more generally useful as a library user’s personal information 
assistant, it also has the ability to manage the user’s loans and explore the 
library catalog.

The service is currently tailored for Helsinki area public libraries’ catalog, 
but can be easily adapted for anybody using MARC21 catalogs.
