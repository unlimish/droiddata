Auto Name:Simple Music Player
Summary:Basic music player with customizable widget
Description:
It takes every song from your device that is more than 20 seconds long, without
the ability to filter by artist etc. The app can be used for renaming the song
title, artist or filename. You can control it easily both from the status bar
notification or with hardware button on your headset.

It contains a customizable widget for your home screen, where you can change the
font color, or the alpha and the color of the background. The widget can be of
size 4x1 or 4x2.
