Summary:Open URLs via select and share
Description:
Easy Open Link makes it easy to open links from text documents via 
the share function of many apps. No more cumbersome copy and paste. 
Easy Open Link also allows you to open several links at the same time.

1. Roughly select the URL(s). It does not matter if the selection also 
contains additional text or white spaces.
2. Press the "share" symbol.
3. Select "open link"

The share function has become a common feature in more recent versions of 
Android. This app requires Android 2.2 or newer, but is most useful with Android 4.0 or later.
