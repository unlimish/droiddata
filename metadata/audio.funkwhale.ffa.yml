Summary: Music player for Funkwhale
Description: |-
    This is the official Android music player for Funkwhale, native to both Android (developed in Kotlin)
    and to Funkwhale (uses its native API instead of Subsonic).
    It is based on the amazing Otter made by apognu and would not be possible without his groundwork!
    You can get help and discuss Funkwhale on Matrix on #funkwhale-android:matrix.org.
