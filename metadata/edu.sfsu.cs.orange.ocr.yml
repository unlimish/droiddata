AutoName: OCR Test
Description: |-
  <b>NOTE:</b> This app is no longer maintained, its repo was archived.

  N.B. The direct translation function won't work as it requires API keys which
  are not in the source. It is possible to long-press the result to copy it, so
  that it can be pasted into a browser or a dictionary.

  Experimental app for optical character recognition (OCR). Runs the Tesseract OCR
  engine on your device to find text in images captured by the device camera,
  without uploading your images to a server. It is suitable for recognizing
  individual words or short phrases of text.

  The default single-shot capture runs OCR on a snapshot image that's captured
  when you click the shutter button, like a regular photo. When the "continuous
  preview" checkbox is checked, the app shows a dynamic, real-time display of what
  the device is recognizing right beside the camera viewfinder. The continuous
  preview mode works best on a fast device.
