AutoName: InformaCam
Summary: Image redactor
Description: |-
    InformaCam is a plugin for ObscuraCam that allows the user, without much
    intervention on their own part, to inflate image and video with extra points of
    data, or metadata. The metadata includes information like the userâ€™s current GPS
    coordinates, altitude, compass bearing, light meter readings, the signatures of
    neighboring devices, cell towers, and wifi networks; and serves to shed light on
    the exact circumstances and contexts under which the digital image was taken.
    Some users will already be familiar with ObscuraCam, which allows for capturing
    and digitally manipulating media. With InformaCam included, the app starts to
    behave almost like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP, supporting non-destructive,
    layer-based edits to media. This means that a version of an image can be created
    with any sensitive image data and metadata preserved and encrypted to trusted
    entities, along with a redacted version that has its metadata stripped which can
    be easily shared.
