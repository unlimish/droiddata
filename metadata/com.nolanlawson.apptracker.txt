Auto Name:App Tracker
Summary:Track your app usage
Description:
App Tracker is a productivity app that keeps track of other apps youâ€™ve used,
and compiles some useful statistics about them (most used, seldom used, recently
used, etc.). You can then display this information in a widget or in the app
itself, and launch them easily.

Uses logcat to figure out what apps have been launched, which means it may not
work on Android 4.1+.
