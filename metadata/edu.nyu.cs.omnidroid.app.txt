Auto Name:Omnidroid
Summary:Automated Event Handler
Description:
'''Note:''' This abandoned app is kept for historical reasons, so you should
rather use its successor [[libretasks.app]].

Omnidroid is an automated event/action manager that allows users to automate
system functionality based on incoming application intents. It also provides a
general plug-in framework that allows any compatible application events to
trigger any other applications actions. An intuitive user interface allows the
user to control what events cause what actions to occur.
