Description: |-
    With the app, the EU digital COVID certificates can be saved
    directly on the smartphone. Those who use it can prove their
    vaccination protection, their recovery or their negative test
    result quickly, securely and digitally. The app can also be
    used to verify the EU digital COVID certificates of other people
    (e.g. family members) on the smartphone. The users of the app
    decide when and to whom to show their information and data.
