Auto Name:Media Button Router
Summary:Map headset buttons
Description:
In android, app writers decide what priority they get when receiving media
buttons (pause/play, previous, next, etc). This can be frustrating to users if
they want to use a different app to handle these button presses on their
Bluetooth devices.

This app attempts to alleviate these pains by providing hands-free selection of
the app you want to use to handle media buttons through text-to-speech and use
of the previous, next, and play buttons for selection.
