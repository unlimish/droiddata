Summary: Stay connected with the fediverse
Description: "koyu.space is a community based on the Mastodon network. This app is\
    \ the entry into the fediverse to communicate with the people you like. koyu.space\
    \ uses Mastodon and it has some advantages. Instead on relying on a centralized\
    \ infrastructure, Mastodon relies on a decentralized infrastructure. That's pretty\
    \ much like E-Mail: You have an e-mail address, but you can also interact with\
    \ people on other servers. Besides that we have some other features included,\
    \ that aren't available on Mastodon."
