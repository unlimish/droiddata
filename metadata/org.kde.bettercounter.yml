AutoName: BetterCounter
Description: |-
    A multi-purpose counter app

    * Track good and bad habits (eg: exercising, smoking, drinking...)
    * Track when's the last time you did something (eg: water your plants, change your bedsheets, poop...)
    * Count your lives in MtG

    Features:

    * Records the date of each individual counter increase, so upcoming versions can graph your data and calculate statistics.
    * Your data is never sent to any server (except for Google's auto-backup, if it's enabled).
    * Simple and will stay this way.
