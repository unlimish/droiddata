Auto Name:Bluetooth Input Emulator
Summary:Use phone/tablet as Bluetooth keyboard
Description:
This project started out as a personal endeavour to use my
smartphone as a controller / keyboard for a PS3. The intent
was not to actually use it as a controller to play games,
but instead to type text messages or perform light navigation
on the PS3, playback music / videos, etc.
