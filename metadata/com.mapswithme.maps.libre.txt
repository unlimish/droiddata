Summary:Fast, detailed and completely offline maps
Description:
Offline maps using OpenStreetMap data with routing and walking directions.
Features:

* Bookmarks of places. Create and import/export from other maps for easy access anytime. KML/KMZ files are supported.

* Offline search. Locate everything you need on the maps and use it as a travel guide!

* Location-sharing. Let your friends and family know where you are! Send a pin of any place on the map via email or SMS.

* Auto-follow mode. When enabled, the map automatically orients itself to the direction you are moving.

This is an unofficial fork without proprietary dependencies and user tracking.
