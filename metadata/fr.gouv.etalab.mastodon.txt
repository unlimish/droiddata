Auto Name:Mastalab
Summary:Multi-account client for Mastodon
Description:
Mastalab allows you to manage several accounts and to switch from one to another
by a simple click. You can start to compose messages and finish them later by a
mechanism of auto-recording, and these messages can be scheduled. Stay aware due
to a system of push notifications when new content is available or when
receiving a notification on an account. Numerous features and settings
parameters will allow to tailor the behavior of the app with what you need.
