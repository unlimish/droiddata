Summary: A privacy centric matrix client
Description: |-
    Please be aware Syphon is still in Open Alpha

    Currently, E2EE only works for direct, one-on-one chats.

    Syphon aims to be built on the foundations of privacy, branding, and user experience
    in an effort to pull others away from proprietary chat and messenger clients to standard.
