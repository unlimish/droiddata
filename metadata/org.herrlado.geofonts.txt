Auto Name:Georgian Fonts Installer
Summary:Install fonts for Georgian script
Description:
Install Georgian fonts if you don't have them already.

Fonts have an AOSP base with added glyphs from
[http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/index.php?title=Besarion_Gugushvili DejaVu].
Installation will overwrite the default fonts that you already have and make a
backup of them.

If it doesn't work maybe you don't have S-OFF or are currently using a
non-default font. Reboot after installation. The suggested log application isn't
free so use [[org.jtb.alogcat]] instead.

Requires root: Yes. Android fonts are always located in /system
.
