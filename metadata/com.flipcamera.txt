Auto Name:Front Camera
Summary:Take photos using the frontfacing camera
Description:
Front Camera does one thing - let you take photos with the front facing camera
on your device. It aims to make it as simple and quick as possible to take
photos with the front facing camera. Click anywhere on the screen to take a
photo, it is saved to your images automatically and ready for you to share to
other apps. The image is automatically rotated so it gets saved upright. It's
flipped on the vertical axis so what you see in the preview matches exactly with
the image that is saved.

Maintainer Notes:
AM.xml uses com.frontcamera id, gradle forces com.flipcamera,
which breaks UCM.
