Summary:Cryptocurrency and bullion price alarms
Description:
Application which monitors cryptocurrencies and bullion prices, and triggers alarms according to user settings.

Supports 2 types of alarms:

* Price Hit - Triggered when price crosses the alarm's upper or lower limit.
* Price Change - Triggered when price changes more than X amount (in currency or percentage) in a specified time frame (e.g. 1 day).

Sound and vibration are configurable globally and individually for each alarm. Lists of exchanges, pairs and alarms are fully searchable, allowing a quick alarm setup and configuration.

Market data is retrieved directly from the exchanges using Wi-Fi or Mobile Data (if allowed). Boilr supports all [https://github.com/andrefbsantos/libdynticker/#supported-exchanges exchanges available on libdynticker], as all their pairs.
