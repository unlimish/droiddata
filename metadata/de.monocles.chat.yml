Summary: monocles xmpp chat client
Description: |-
    Finally the first release of the monocles chat an ecofriendly and ethical chat client

    The chat is running through an encrypted and self sufficient server powered by our own solar system

    monocles chat is a fork of blabber.im and Conversations with some changes,
    to improve usability.

    Connection security and the protection of personal data are very important for
    us, so we enforce encrypted connections between messenger and server, making it
    almost impossible to intercept and read your messages by strangers.
    If that's not enough for you, end-to-end message encryption such as OMEMO
    or OpenPGP can be used. This allows messages to be encrypted on the sending
    device and decrypted only by the receiving device intended for reception.
