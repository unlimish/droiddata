Auto Name:OpenKeychain
Summary:Encrypt files and communications with OpenPGP.
Description:
OpenKeychain helps you communicate more privately and securely. It uses
high-quality modern encryption to ensure that your messages can be read
only by the people you send them to, others can send you messages that
only you can read, and these messages can be digitally signed so the
people getting them are sure who sent them. OpenKeychain is based on the
well established OpenPGP standard making encryption compatible across
your devices and operating systems.

Modern encryption is based on digital "keys". OpenKeychain stores and
manages your keys, and those of the people you communicate with, on your
Android. It also helps you find others' keys online, and interchange keys
by touching devices. But its most frequent use is in using those keys to
encrypt and decrypt messages.

OpenKeychain integrates with

* K-9 Mail
* Conversations
* and many more...

OpenKeychain is designed to be trustworthy. Itâ€™s Free Software with no
secrets; anyone can examine and validate every bit of it.

Permissions:

* Full network access: To query keyservers
* Near Field Communication: To exchange keys via NFC; Yubikey NEO support
* Storage: To import/export keys from sd card
* Identity/Contact: To pre-fill name, email, and search queries; integration with Android's contacts
