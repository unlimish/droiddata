Auto Name:Angulo
Summary:Angle & Distance Measuring
Description:
Angulo allows to measure angles by pointing the device, using the internal
acceleration (gravity) and magnetic sensors. The interface is very simple
and easy-to-use.  It can also be used as a water-level and to measure
inclines of streets or hills.

A second activity, Tri-Angulo, can use the data provided by angle sensors
to measure distances to points targetted in the device camera.  This is
useful, for instance, to get quick estimates of sizes of a room or
for other applications.
