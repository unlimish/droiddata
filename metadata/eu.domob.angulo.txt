Auto Name:Angulo
Summary:Angle and Distance Measuring
Description:
Angulo allows to measure angles by pointing the device, using the internal
acceleration (gravity) and magnetic sensors. The interface is very simple and
easy-to-use. It can also be used as a water-level and to measure inclines of
streets or hills.

A second activity, Tri-Angulo, can use the data provided by angle sensors to
measure distances to points targetted in the device camera. This is useful, for
instance, to get quick estimates of sizes of a room or for other applications.
