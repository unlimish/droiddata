Auto Name:Mustard {MOD}
Summary:Microblogging client
Description:
Client for <a href="http://status.net/wiki/Take_a_tour">StatusNet</a> (now known as
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/social">GNU social</a>). GNU social is a microblogging
platform somewhat like Twitter, but decentralized. Some examples are:
<a href="https://status.fsf.org">fsf.org</a>, and <a href="http://bka.li">bka.li</a>. (The latter is in
German, as is the website)

Twitter is disabled in this build, but in future versions it will be possible to
enter oAuth credentials into the app, after registering your own client at
dev.twitter.com. It is already possible to add oAuth credentials for StatusNet
sites.

Status: Abandoned
