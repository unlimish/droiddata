Auto Name:InformaCam
Summary:Image redactor
Description:
InformaCam is a plugin for ObscuraCam that allows the user, without much
intervention on their own part,
to inflate image and video with extra points of data, or metadata. The
metadata includes information like
the userâ€™s current GPS coordinates, altitude, compass bearing, light meter
readings, the signatures of
neighboring devices, cell towers, and wifi networks; and serves to shed light
on the exact circumstances
and contexts under which the digital image was taken. Some users will
already be familiar with ObscuraCam,
which allows for capturing and digitally manipulating media. With
InformaCam included, the app starts to
behave almost like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP, supporting non-destructive,
layer-based edits to media. This
means that a version of an image can be created with any sensitive image data
and metadata preserved and
encrypted to trusted entities, along with a redacted version that has its
metadata stripped which can be easily shared.
