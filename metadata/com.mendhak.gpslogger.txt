Auto Name:GPSLogger
Summary:Battery efficient GPS Logger
Description:
GPSLogger uses the GPS capabilities of your device to log coordinates to a GPX
or KML file at regular intervals. This can be particularly useful if you want to
geotag your photos after a day out or share your travel route with someone. The
purpose of this application is to save you battery power when abroad and to last
as long as possible.

Unfortunately the app will crash if you attempt to upload tracks to Dropbox,
Google or OSM as keys for these services aren't in the source code. Email is OK,
and it works with with one press as long as the SMTP server details are all
entered correctly. FTP functionality has been recently introduced.

More recent versions of this depend on proprietary Google Play services, and
will not be updated here. There are more freedom-respecting loggers available,
such as [[me.guillaumin.android.osmtracker]], which we would recommend using
instead.
