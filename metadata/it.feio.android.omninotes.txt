Maintainer Notes:
The used location library requires play-services, and thus the buid fails,
see https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/issues/16#note_22128654.

Replacing with microg fails as well, class not implemented. See issue at
https://github.com/microg/android_external_GmsLib/issues/5 -- maybe then
"Auto Update Mode:Version %v" applies.
