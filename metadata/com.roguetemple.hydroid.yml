AutoName: Hydra Slayer
Summary: Adventure game
Description: |-
    Hydra Slayer is a roguelike game where combat has been inspired by some
    mathematical puzzles about brave heroes slaying many headed beasts. This might
    look like a standard dungeon crawler, but the puzzle element is important, and
    the later game is meant to be challenging.
