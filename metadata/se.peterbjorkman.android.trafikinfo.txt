Auto Name:Trafikinfo.nu
Summary:Show Swedish traffic information
Description:
This application shows traffic information received from Trafikverket,
the Swedish Transport Administration.

Requires proprietary Google Maps to be installed on your device and even then
the maps won't be visible because F-droid can't include API keys in the build. If you need
the maps feature try the developer build from the website.
