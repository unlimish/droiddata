Summary:Board game
Description:
Strategy board game similar to the famous board game Blokus.

Try to place as many tiles on the board as possible, keeping in mind only two
simple rules: your tiles must touch a corner of one of your previously placed
tiles, but they must not share an edge. Can you play more tiles than your
opponents?
