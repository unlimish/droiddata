Auto Name:PilferShush Jammer
Summary:Block unwanted use of onboard microphone
Description:
Uses a passive jamming technique that engages the microphone thereby blocking
other apps from using it. But does NOT listen to or record any of the audio from
the microphone. It uses 0% CPU and no noticeable battery use. However is not
intended to be left on permanently due to the variety of triggers that can cause
audio_focus_state changes (VOIP etc).

* Manual start
* Notification post when running
* Auto stop and restart when telephony interrupts
* Currently relies on audio_focus_state changes for auto-switching
.
