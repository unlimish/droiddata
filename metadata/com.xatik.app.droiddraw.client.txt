Summary:Automated drawing
Description:
Control a pen holding Android and create complex shapes using part of the LOGO
programming language. Not sure what Turtle Graphics and LOGO programming is? The
original Turtle Graphics allowed a user to enter commands which represented what
would be drawn out out on a Cartesian plane. Droid Draw brings this same
functionality to Android users.

Not sure what to do? Make sure to check out the help section in the app or visit
the website. There is information on how to use the app and what every command
does.
