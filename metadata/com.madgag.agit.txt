Auto Name:Agit
Summary:Read software source code
Description:
Clone remote git repositories onto your phone!
* Just like regular Git, the full history is stored for offline access.
* Animated Diffs - Watch diffs smoothly transition from Before to After.
* Supports git, http, https protocols. SSH for private repos is also possible
* Periodic sync enabled on Android 2.3 and later: latest commits fetched quarter-hourly.

Currently this is a 'read-only' client. You can clone & fetch, but not commit and push.
