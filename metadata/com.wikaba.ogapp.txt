Auto Name:Ogame on Android
Summary:Third-party client for Ogame
Description:
Playing Ogame on a mobile browser eats up a lot of memory, which
makes performance on lower-end devices horrible. This ongoing
project aims to provide a client for Ogame which would cut down
on memory usage while playing the game.

At the current moment, this application can only view events from
the overview screen. Not all mission types are properly identified,
but all missions will show up on the screen.

This application is a third-party application for Ogame. This application
is '''NOT''' an official tool from Gameforge.
