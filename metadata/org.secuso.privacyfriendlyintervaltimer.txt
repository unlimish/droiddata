Summary:Privacy Friendly App that supports you during circuit exercise sessions
Description:
Privacy Friendly Interval Timer supports the user during his/her circuit
training session and helps him achieve his/her training goals. In order to
support the user during his training, the app provides stopwatches, which can be
configured according to the user’s own training and resting phases. In addition,
the app reminds the user of previously defined training sessions via a
notification. To check the user’s goals and to recognize training progress, the
app offers the possibility to retrieve statistics about the training times and
the calories burned in a daily, weekly or monthly overview.

This App requires minimal permissions and is part of the Privacy Friendly Apps
group developed by the research group SECUSO at Technische Universität
Darmstadt.
