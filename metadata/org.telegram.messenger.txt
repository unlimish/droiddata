Auto Name:Telegram
Summary:Messaging client
Description:
Client for the Telegram messaging platform. Chat with friends, start group
chats and share all kinds of content. All of your messages and conversations
are stored in Telegram's cloud.

The messaging platform is aimed at mobile devices, but desktop and web clients
exist as well.

Several proprietary parts were removed from the original Telegram client,
including Google Play Services for the location services and HockeySDK for
self-updates.

Anti-Feature: Non-Free Network, since the servers run proprietary software.
