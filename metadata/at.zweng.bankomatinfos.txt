Name:Bankomat Card Infos
Auto Name:Bankomat Card Infos
Summary:Read bank card via NFC
Description:
Tries to read the last transactions and some general infos from a NFC-enabled
Austrian Bankomatkarte (Maestro debit card) via NFC.
It may not work on all cards, only tested with cards from Bank Austria for now.

It checks if the card contains the Paylife Quick application
(`AID D040000001000002`) and the Maestro (Bankomat) application
(`AID A0000000043060`) and tries to read some free accessible files
(no authentication is performed to card).

WARNING: This app has been superseded by [[at.zweng.bankomatinfos]] and
will be disabled in the future.
