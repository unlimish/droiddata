Summary:(one sentence, no more than 30-50 chars, no trailing punctuation)
Description:
Description of what the app does, starting on a new line. It should be as
objective as possible and wrapped at 80 chars (except links and list items).

A blank line means a line break, i.e. the end of a paragraph.

Bulleted lists can be used:

* Item 1
* Item 2

Links can be added like this:
[https://github.com/org/project/raw/master/res/raw/changelog.xml Changelog]

Links to other apps too: [[some.other.app]]

To close a multiline field, add a new line with only a dot.
