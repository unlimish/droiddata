Auto Name:JustChess
Summary:Chess for one or two players
Description:
Play chess against a very simple author written chess engine, or against  a
friend in pass and play mode.

Simple features include:

* One or Two player
* Move suggestion
* Piece move highlighting
* A 3 ply open source chess engine written by the author

This game is not hard to beat. It was a learning curve to create a chess engine,
but is playable, and supports two players in a pass and play fashion. All of the
material is available for use from the source files.
