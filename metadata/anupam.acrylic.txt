Auto Name:Acrylic Paint
Summary:Simple finger painting
Description:
Acrylic Paint is a coloring tool based on the FingerPaint project
taken from API demos.

Notes from maintainers:
The original author of the app had disappeared from a lot of time, so now other developers maintain it in order to apply patches for bugs.
.

Maintainer Notes:
The original author Anupam Shrivastava ([https://github.com/anupam1525]), it's disappeared from the web! But his last words were: «Valerio Bozzolan, please apply yourself this patch» (https://github.com/anupam1525/AcrylicPaint/issues/2) but without never merging the bug-patch by months to the main branch. So the app now it's maintained by Valerio Bozzolan, only waiting for the author to show up.
(P.S. Dear Anupam, knock once if you're still alive!)
