Auto Name:MinX
Summary:Minimalistic, text based web browser
Description:
Simple web browser that focuses on text.

This is intended for those users who don't like adverts on webpages or enjoy
reading content from websites but unfortunately these websites don't scale well
on smartphone screens. Minx grabs textual data from websites and represents it
to the user in a readable format. This app also tries to remove any possibility
of websites tracking user data as no cookies or user details are shared with the
website. It uses jsoup to parse HTML data into string values which can further
be displayed to the user.

Features:

* Ad free and no user information tracking.
* Load any url into the app and it will load it as long as the url is valid.
* Change font size according to your liking.
* Save webpages offline.
* Secure your archive with a PIN.
