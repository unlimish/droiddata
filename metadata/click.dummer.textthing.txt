Auto Name:TextThing
Summary:Text editor
Description:
TextThing is a simple text file editor for Android. You can use it via a file
manager app. I use it to write some notes. The fixed default file path is
Documents/click.dummer.textthing/notes.txt . If you open the app, this file will
be opened, created and used for store.

There is no file manager integrated.
