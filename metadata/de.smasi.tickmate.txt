Auto Name:Tickmate
Summary:One bit journal
Description:
Tickmate is basically a one bit journal. For each day, you can specify whether
something occurred or not. The occurrences can be arbitrary things, like
flossing your teeth or having a drink. You are able to quantify your habits
and the accumulated data can be displayed for the past weeks or months to
track changes over time. This way, it may help you to get over your old habits
or embody new ones.
