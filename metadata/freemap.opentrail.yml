AutoName: OpenTrail
Description: |-
    OpenStreetMap-based Android app for UK walkers and other countryside users,
    highlighting rights of way and showing contours from OS OpenData. Allows
    both online and offline use. In addition to navigation, walkers may share
    and download footpath issues (blockages, directions etc) and walking
    routes.

    Antifeatures:
    * NonFreeNet: The map data is OpenStreetMap-derived but it is downloaded
    from the Freemap server. OpenTrail does not currently send any personal
    information (such as your Google login) to the Freemap server. All data sent
    is completely anonymous. Location tracking (GPS) is used to find your
    location and to download nearby points of interest from the server. Server
    requests (to find all points of interest close to a given GPS location) are
    logged using standard server (Apache) logging; however they are not
    associated with a username or name.
