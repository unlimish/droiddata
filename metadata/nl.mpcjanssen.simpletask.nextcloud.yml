AutoName: Simpletask donation key
Description: |-
    A simple task list manager that strives to have just enough features to do GTD
    (the Getting Things Done methodology), but no more.

    Based on the [http://todotxt.com todo.txt] app so all info is stored in a single
    text file called todo.txt.

    Note that, with this version, you will need to take care of backups yourself.

    * Todo list stored in the documented todo.txt format
    * Comprehensive filtering and multi sort
    * Create calendar reminders for specific tasks directly from the app
    * Select on or more tasks and press overflow menu->Add reminder
    * Share the complete tasklist or selected tasks using the Android share feature
    * Tasks can deferred into the future. Combined with the "Creation date in future" sort it allows you to get tasks out of your face (as in 1MTD/MYN)
