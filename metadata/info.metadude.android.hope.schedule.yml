Description: |
  Program app for the HOPE conference 2022

  https://hope.net

  A New HOPE will be a transformational conference
  for the hacker community -- in so many ways. We've
  all been through a lot, and it's been challenging.
  It is a time to come together again to inspire,
  transform, and share HOPE.

  A New HOPE will be live and in person, and at a
  great new venue. St. John's University has more
  space, more possibilities, and offers us much
  more support for HOPE far into the future.

  We will miss our old long-time home, the Hotel
  Pennsylvania, which is, sadly, being demolished.
  But we are now ready for our next chapter. We hope
  you'll join us for this this exciting bit of history
  as we create A New HOPE together.
