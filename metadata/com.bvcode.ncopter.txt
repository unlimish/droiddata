Summary:GCS for ArduCopter/ArduPirate
Description:
Provides a GCS for the ArduCopter/ArduPirate family of copters. Status readouts,
GPS tracking/logging, PID tuning, calibration (Transmitter and sensors) and
sensor readouts. Very useful for tuning in the field. Note that a Bluetooth to
APM link is required. Visit the website for details.

N.B It isn't possible to view the photos on a map because Google Maps is the
only map source and f-droid can't supply an API key to use it.
