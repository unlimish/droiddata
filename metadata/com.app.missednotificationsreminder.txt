Auto Name:MissedNotificationsReminder
Summary:Periodical sound reminder for missed notifications
Description:
Unfortunately Android doesn't have default integrated functionality to notify
the user periodically about missing calls/messages/other notifications via sound
(only LED is blinking). This tool allows you to monitor notifications from any
applications which are important for you and perform sound reminder
periodically.

Maintainer Notes:
Build both flavors with each release.
VC is generated at buildtime, cannot set UCM.
VC starts with api version, so we will run into problems: once we have
more v18 builds than archive policy allows in general, even new v14
builds will only deploy to archive...

Update Check Mode:None
