AutoName: Globular
Summary: Cross-implementation Lightning Network remote wallet
Description: |-
    Globular is the first cross-implementation LN remote wallet.

    It connects to [https://gitlab.com/inbitcoin/lighter Lighter], a LN node wrapper, with macaroon authentication. Lighter is open source and can easily be self hosted.

    At the moment, Globular offers:

    * first time configuration procedure
    * pin entry and session timeout
    * on-chain and off-chain balances
    * a transfers list: on-chain transactions and off-chain invoices and payments
    * a transfer detail view
    * payments over the LN
    * creation and sharing of LN invoices
    * showing and sharing the node's URI to ease opening of channels to the LN node
    * a background service regularly checking the connection to Lighter and sending error messages through in-app and drawer notifications
    * a settings view to unlock Lighter, manage PIN, demo mode and every Lighter connection parameter

    The demo mode, available in settings, makes Globular connect to a testnet Lighter instance (keeping stored credentials untouched).
