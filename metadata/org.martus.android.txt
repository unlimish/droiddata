Auto Name:Martus
Summary:secure documentation for human rights defenders, activists & journalists
Description:
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: Before running Mobile Martus, you (or someone you
designate) must have a Martus desktop client account set up on a computer to
receive your Mobile Martus data, and you will need that account info to
configure Mobile Martus.  If you do not already have it, you can download the
Martus desktop client and follow the installation instructions in the Reference
Guide at https://www.martus.org.

Mobile Martus is a secure, Android-based mobile documentation application built
on Benetech’s Martus technology, which allows human rights defenders, activists,
journalists, and other users anywhere in the world to securely gather
information about human rights violations.

The Mobile Martus application allows users to send crucial data from the
field—text, photographs, audio and video—to the Martus network of secure
servers. The data is automatically encrypted on the mobile device, and when
being sent to the server, so it is protected in case the device is lost, stolen
or confiscated. A user—or someone they designate—can later retrieve their data,
and can search, analyze and report on the information, using the Martus desktop
client software (https://www.martus.org) on their computer.
