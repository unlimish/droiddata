Summary: Offline-compatible browser for cultural events in Leipzig
Description: |-
    What's happening in Leipzig?
    Download and browse all the events, which are currently listed on kreuzer-leipzig.de.
    You can easily download all events for the next month and browse them in a comfortable way. Find events by name, by category or by location. Mark events as favorite and get reminded one week before and again one day before the event.
    More event calendars will be integrated in the future. Let me know about features you would like to see in the app by contributing on the Gitlab site. .
