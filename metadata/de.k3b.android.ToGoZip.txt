Name:Android toGoZip
Summary:"Add To Zip" for android's share/send menu.
Description:
Easy collection of files from every supporting app into one zip-file while
beeing 'on the go' or offline.

This collecting "2go.zip"-file is like a suitcase where you can put things (files)
into from nearly everywhere (from every app that supports 'share'/'send')
and that can travel everywhere (via email, bluetooth, nfc).

The program's author uses ToGoZip to collect new android calendar entries with [[de.k3b.android.calendar.ics.adapter]] 
that should be later imported into the desctop-pcs-s calender.

'''Required Android Permissions:'''
* WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE used to store the created/updated zip-file.
