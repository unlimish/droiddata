Auto Name:InTheClear
Summary:Android mobile alerting and secure wipe application
Description:
InTheClear is a suite of mobile applications designed to keep users safer in 
difficult situations by using their phone's built-in tools. At its core are two 
main features: Emergency SMS and Data Wipe. At installation, InTheClear walks a 
new user through the process of configuring each of these features. The user 
can then activate either Emergency SMS or Data Wipe individually, on an ad-hoc 
basis. In addition, they can simultaneously activate *both* Emergency SMS and 
Data Wipe via Panic!, a simple, one-touch feature of InTheClear.
