Auto Name:Seafile
Summary:File synchronization
Description:
Client for the Seafile cloud file server and project management software.
If you are in a small team with a few people, you can create a group in Seafile
and invite other team members.
Team members can then maintain file libraries together and collaborate
around them.

You can try the [http://seafile.cc/demo demo], sign up for an account
at the website, or since the server-side is also free-as-in-freedom, it can be
installed on any server and configured to work with the app.
