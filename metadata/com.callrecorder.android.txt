Auto Name:Call recorder for Android
Summary:Record calls
Description:
Records all incoming and outgoing calls from/to your phone. Your calls are saved
in mp3 format and can be sent by various methods.

The main application screen contains a list of all calls with details of phone
numbers, date and time of a call. A click on one of the items will provide you
with 3 options: erase record, send record and play record.

In order to allow or disallow recordings open the main menu and choose
enable/disable recordings.

This is a fork of the discontinued [[com.call.recorder]]. The fork should work
with newer devices based on Android 4.1 and above.
