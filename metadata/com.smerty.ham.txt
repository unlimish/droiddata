Description:
Solar / calculated band conditions, Maidenhead Grid Locator & Callsign lookups
via QRZ.com XML subscription.
If you have a non-premium (free) account on QRZ.com, you will only get the
name and country of callsigns.
We are looking at offering more callsign databases.
Many free sources only contain US hams, which is of
limited use for many users.
