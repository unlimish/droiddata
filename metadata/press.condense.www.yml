AutoName: News Diet
Summary: A news recommendation engine with user customizable parameters
Description: News apps like Google News, Flipboard, BBC show trending articles written
    inthe last few days. If say there are hundred articles written in a day, thesenews
    apps pick just a few of them. It is a time saving feature. But theylack a flexibility.
    Consider you havenâ€™t read any news for the last 1 monthor 1 year. If you open
    any of the news apps or news websites, you will stillbe shown trending articles
    written in the last few days and not last month orlast year.Hence this app picks
    popular articles of a website in a time rangeyou can specify.For example, techcrunch.com
    has 292,172 articles. But this appsorts all those articles based on popularity.
    This app is a a webview ofwww.condense.press and has PWA(Progressive Web App)
    features..
