Auto Name:Marble One
Summary:Peg solitaire (or Solo Noble) board game
Description:
How to play:

1. Find two marbles and an empty location lying together along a line -- that
is "marble-marble-empty" or "empty -marble-marble". This pattern can be in
horizontal or vertical direction.

2. Select the marble away from the empty location. Then select the empty
location. The selected marble will jump over the adjacent one to the empty
location: now the pattern will be "empty-empty-marble" or "marble-empty-empty".
The middle marble gets removed by this. Similarly, go on removing the marbles
one by one till you reach a state when there are no two marbles together with
an adjacent vacant position.
