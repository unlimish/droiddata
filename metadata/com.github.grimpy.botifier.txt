Auto Name:Botifier
Summary:Send notifications via Bluetooth
Description:
* Show notifcations on car radio 
* Show application as artist
* Show summary as album
* Show full notification text as title (can be split over multiple chunks max length is configurable)
* Play notification via TTS (text to speech)
* Use next / previous track to navigate through notifications
* Use pause / play button to remove notifcation
* Use forward button to close notification stream might help to regain focus to previous playing audio.

To test if your media device (car radio) supports AVRCP 1.3 play a mp3 song 
which has id3 information set and check if this information is shown on the 
media device.

There are two ways to provide this application with info about notifications 
via accesiblities or via notification access. 
The later one is the prefered method which is only support on Android 4.3 and up.
To enable Botifier via Notification Access (Android 4.3 only):
Goto Settings -> Security -> Notification Access -> Enable Botifier (Setting only available if Botifier is installed)
To enable Botifier via Accessiblity:
Goto Settings -> Accessiblity -> Enable Botifier
Do not enable both methods which will cause unexpected behaviour.
