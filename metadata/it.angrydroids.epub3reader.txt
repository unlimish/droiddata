Auto Name:EPUB3 Reader
Summary:eBook reader with parallel texts
Description:
The goal of this project consists in exploring new ways of interacting with
rich, structured eBooks in EPUB format.

The rationale behind this choice is simple:

* EPUB is an open format for eBooks and it is the de facto standard for non-Amazon eBooks
* The current reading systems (eReaders, desktop programs, apps) are not suitable for reading structured, complex eBooks, as they are almost always designed with linear-reading books in mind.
