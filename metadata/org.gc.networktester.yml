Description: |-
    Is that open wifi really letting you access the web? Android Network Tester
    quickly validates you're connected to the real web (by downloading a dedicated
    36 bytes file and checking its content). If the hotspot is actually redirecting
    you to a billing or authentication portal, you'll know instantly.
