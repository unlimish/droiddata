Auto Name:orWall
Summary:Force apps to use TOR
Description:
Force selected applications through Orbot while preventing unchecked
applications to have network access.

In short, orWall will add special iptables rules in order to redirect
traffic for applications through Tor; it will also add required rules
in order to block traffic for other apps. The redirection is based on
the application user id. Each android application runs as a dedicated
user, and iptables has support for traffic filtering based on the process
owner, meaning it's really easy and pretty safe to do this kind of thing
on an Android device.

The application works in two stages: first, an init-script will block
all incoming and outgoing traffic. This should prevent leaks, knowing
Android sends stuff before you can even access the device. Second stage
comes once the device is fully booted: orWall itself takes the lead on
the firewall, and add required rules in order to allow Orbot traffic,
and redirect selected application to Orbot TransPort.
