Summary:Online tag-based image archive viewer
Description:
Connect to *booru tag-based image archives and browse by tags.

The safebooru.org site is preloaded which shows Anime images that are considered
'safe for work'. Note that the images there are usually of high quality and
though the app is fast, a lot of data will be downloaded.
