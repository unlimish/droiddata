Auto Name:JLyr Lyrics
Summary:Get lyrics
Description:
You can search for lyrics from a list of lyrics websites without leaving the
app or go to popular search engines. If you have a Scrobbler like
[[net.jjc1138.android.scrobbler]] or [[com.adam.aslfms]] installed then JLyr
can detect
what you are listening to and search for the lyrics automatically.
The app is also able
to detect what the stock Music app ([[com.android.music]])
is playing, without a Scrobbler.
