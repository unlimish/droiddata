    * RunningAHEAD

    Explanation to anti-features:

    * NonFreeNet: Uploading to Strava and other services makes use of non free net services. (The uploading is open similar to uploading a .tcx file, but the services are not open.)
    * UpstreamNonFree: The Play version (can be installed at the same time as the F-Droid version) has additional features using non free libraries, see below

    Features removed compared to Play version:

    * Map view (no MapBox API key in free)
    * WearOS app (requires non-free Play services)
    * HR ANT+ connectivity (requires closed source lib)
    * Runalyze and Dropbox upload (Requires API keys. Runalyze test upload possible.)
    * Download customized apk to device (F-Droid binary is universal for all supported binaries).
