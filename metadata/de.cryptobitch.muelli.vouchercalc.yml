AutoName: Voucher Calc
Description: |-
  If you receive vouchers (from, say, sodexo) which have a fixed value and you
  need to pay a certain amount, you may wonder how many vouchers you have to spend
  and how much tip you may be giving with an additional voucher.

  Features:

  * Enter price you need to pay
  * Select the maximum number of vouchers you carry
  * It shows how much you still have to pay
  * Or how much extra you'd give with an additional voucher
