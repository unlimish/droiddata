Auto Name:Pretty Good Music Player Launcher Mode
Summary:Music player running as launcher
Description:
Based on [[com.smithdtyler.prettygoodmusicplayer]], a music player that focuses
on basics, rock solid music playing, this player can be set to act as launcher.

Tired of music players that take forever to start up because they're loading ads
or trying to download stuff? Of music players that ignore Bluetooth controls, or
stop responding after a few minutes? I was too, so I wrote this app!

Feature Details:

* Audiobook mode for resuming playback where you left off
* Notification controls
* The color theme and text size are now configurable!
* This player protects against accidental pausing when your phone is jostled and the headphone cord shifts. I added this because it was annoying when my phone was in my pocket and would auto-pause because the headphone cable was bumped.
* Plays .mp3, .m4p, .m4a, .aac, and many more types of audio files.
* Accepts play, pause, previous, and next commands from Bluetooth headsets.
* When you select 'All songs' for a given artist, the songs are ordered by album, not alphabetically.
* Automatically pauses and resumes when another app (e.g. GPS) needs audio.
* If another app needs audio for more than 30 seconds (e.g. a phone call), it does not automatically resume.
* "Repeat All" is always on.
* If you click "back" too quickly, it double checks that you want to leave before quitting.
