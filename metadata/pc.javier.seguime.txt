Summary:Follow where your device goes without being followed by you
Description:
It stores GPS coordinates and sends them to your Web server so you can see where
is the device.

* You can build your own server (more privacy).
* Send coordinates by Telegram (Bot) and SMS.
* Settings from the website.
* Control over time of activity and downtime to save battery.
* Easy to create accounts without requesting personal data.

It's just a project, so it can only be used for experimental purposes and not
for security purposes.
