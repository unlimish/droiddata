Auto Name:GnuPrivacyGuard
Summary:GNUPG for Android
Description:
GNU Privacy Guard Command-Line (gpgcli) gives you command line access to the
entire GnuPG suite of encryption software.
GPG is GNUâ€™s tool for end-to-end secure communication and encrypted data
storage.
GnuPG 2.1 is the new modularized version of GnuPG that now supports OpenPGP
and S/MIME.

Before using gpgcli, be sure to launch the app and let it finish its
installation process.
Once it has completed, then you're ready to use it.
The easiest way to get started with gpgcli is to install
[[jackpal.androidterm]].
gpgcli will automatically configure Android Terminal Emulator as long as you
have the "Allow PATH extensions" settings enabled.
