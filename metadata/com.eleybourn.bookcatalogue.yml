AutoName: Book Catalogue
Description: |-
  N.B The GoodReads integration won't work as there aren't any API keys in the
  source code to make it work. If you are switching between different apk
  signatures it is a good idea to export your list before uninstalling.

  This is a simple book catalogue application, to store a list of your books.
  Books can be added either manually, by ISBN, or by barcode if you have
  https://f-droid.org/packages/com.google.zxing.client.android installed. In the case of the last two
  methods, information including cover images is sought on the internet meaning
  you can have a thorough record of a book in as little as 30 seconds.

  One thing to watch out for is that in rare case, barcodes do not contain ISBN
  numbers. This will usually apply to older trade or pulp books and a barcode is
  often also present inside the front cover. If no ISBN is present a search for
  the author's name may still give results.
