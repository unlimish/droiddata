Auto Name:OCR Test
Summary:Convert camera images to text
Description:
N.B. The direct translation function won't work as it requires API keys which
are not in the source. It is possible to long-press the result to copy it, so
that it can be pasted into a browser or a dictionary.

Experimental app for optical character recognition (OCR). Runs the Tesseract OCR
engine on your device to find text in images captured by the device camera,
without uploading your images to a server. It is suitable for recognizing
individual words or short phrases of text.

The default single-shot capture runs OCR on a snapshot image that's captured
when you click the shutter button, like a regular photo. When the "continuous
preview" checkbox is checked, the app shows a dynamic, real-time display of what
the device is recognizing right beside the camera viewfinder. The continuous
preview mode works best on a fast device.
