Auto Name:OCR Test
Summary:Convert camera images to text
Description:
N.B. The direct translation function won't work as it requires API keys which are
not in the source.
It is possible to long-press the result to copy it, so that it can be pasted
into a browser or a dictionary.

Experimental app for optical character recognition (OCR).
Runs the Tesseract OCR engine on your device to find text in images
captured by the device camera, without uploading your images to a server.
It is suitable for recognizing individual words or short phrases of text.

The default single-shot capture runs OCR on a snapshot image that's captured
when you click the shutter button, like a regular photo.
When the "continuous preview" checkbox is checked, the app shows a dynamic,
real-time display of what the device is recognizing right beside the camera
viewfinder. The continuous preview mode works best on a fast device.
