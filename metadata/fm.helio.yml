AutoName: Helio
Description: |-
    Most of the DAW interfaces often seem overcomplicated,
    and they only tend to get more and more bloated over time.
    Many of them are commercial, proprietary-licensed and almost none
    of them support all major operating systems at the same time.

    Helio is an attempt to rethink a music sequencer to create a
    tool that feels right.

    It aims to be a modern music creation software,
    featuring linear-based/pattern-based sequencer with clean UI,
    integrated version control for synchronizing project between
    devices, microtonal temperaments support, small portable builds
    and more; mainly targeted at hobbyist composers, game developers
    and indie artists.
