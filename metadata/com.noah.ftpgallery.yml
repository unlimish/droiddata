AutoName: FTP Gallery
Summary: Retrieve files from an FTP-server and show them like in a gallery in-app
Description: This app can connect to an FTP-server and navigate through its directories.
    You can download any file and the app will show mediafiles (such as photos and
    videos) like you are used to it from your phones native gallery. To make this
    a smooth experience, the app will download the next media files while showing
    you one, so if you switch left and right, it will load faster. As this is the
    priority, you can't upload files yet. But you can add as many connections as you
    wish and there are several settings. Nevertheless, the most important feature
    is the dark background.
