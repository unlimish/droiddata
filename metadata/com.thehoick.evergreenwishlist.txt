Auto Name:Evergreen Wishlist
Summary:Lookup books in your Amazon Wish List at your local library
Description:
Evergreen Wishlist allows you to lookup books on your Amazon Wish List
at your local library. Well there is a catch or two. Your library needs
to use the Evergreen ILS system for their catalog. The other catch is
that at this time Evergreen Wishlist can only lookup the first (or most
recent) fifteen books added to your list.

The 15 book limit is due to how Amazon's site works, and that may change
in the future. Software usually gets better over time right?
