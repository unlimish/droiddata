Auto Name:Tiny Travel Tracker
Summary:Secure long term GPS tracker and log
Description:
Tiny Travel Tracker could be described as a GPS journal. It's different from
other GPS trackers because:

* It can be safely left on all the time. It keeps track of it's own battery usage to prevent excessive battery drain.
* It can handle hundreds of thousands of points-- years with of data, all at once. No need to worry about trying to categorize and save it yourself. It's all there and always available.
* The data is encrypted using 256 AES keys and can be password protected. (It is as secure as communicating with your banking website.) No other malicious apps can make use of the GPS data, and it is completely private. Your data is not uploaded to any website but remains on your phone at all times, and is easily wiped away by uninstalling the app.

It's meant for both traveling to far off places and reviewing your day to day
activities.

It can find the answer to questions such as:

* Where did I really go when I got lost on top of that mountain?
* How many times have I been to the gym in the last month?
* Where are some different routes to work that I haven't tried yet, and how long to the routes I choose actually take?
* How many hours have I actually spent in that pool hall?
* What did I do all day on October 27th, 2010?
* Where was that little shop I visited when I was wandering around Tokyo?

It also is useful in situations where you don't have internet access. All map
tiles previously viewed are cached on the phone, so even without internet, you
can use the map as long as you've looked at previously viewed area. In addition,
since the GPS points are stored on the phone, they are always present,
regardless of internet availability.
