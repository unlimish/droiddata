Auto Name:Audiometry Made Easy
Summary:Test your hearing capabilities
Description:
'''Note:''' this app is no longer actively maintained.

AME is designed to diagnose hearing loss without the need for expensive medical
machines. Using signal analysis and your phone or tablet's own microphone, AME
can calibrate virtually any pair of earphones for a hearing test that will
return the user's hearing thresholds in dB HL. It also provides services for the
user to save test results, view them later, and email test results anywhere from
within the app.
