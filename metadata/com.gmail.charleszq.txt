Auto Name:Flickr Viewer HD
Summary:Flickr viewer for tablets
Description:
N.B It isn't possible to view geo-tagged photos on a map because Google Maps
is the only map source and f-droid can't supply an API key to use it.	

Anti-feature: Dependencies. It's necessary for Google Maps to be already
installed either as an app or as a shared system library for this app to be
installable. We will be able to remove this dependency soon.
