Maintainer Notes:
* Versions <= 2.0 do not build from the current repo, but one needs to use the old repo <https://github.com/smeir/Berlin-Vegan-Guide>
* Auto Update Mode is working, but only with a hack: with commit dd0b38a in fdroidserver the tag is used as versionname, if the versionname could not be parse from the manifest or gradle files.
* Archive Policy: 'Currently the only supported format is "n versions", where n is the number of versions to keep.'
* Auto Update Mode: '... if an app always has a tag "2.7.2" corresponding to version 2.7.2, you would simply specify "Version %v"'
* Update Check Mode: '... when apps tag non-release versions such as X.X-alpha, so you can filter them out with something like .*[0-9]$ which requires tag names to end with a digit.'
