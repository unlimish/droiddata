Auto Name:Berlin Vegan
Summary:Guide for vegan shopping in Berlin
Description:
Quick access to an overview of the vegan food and shopping possibilities in
Berlin, Germany -- even while you are out and about. We have arranged all
the information and divided it up into frequently used categories. After
you have selected a category (e.g. 'restaurants'), the results will be
automatically sorted and shown in order of distance from your current
location. With the help of the number of stars, you can also see how vegan-
friendly a place is considered to be.

What is more, the guide takes opening hours into consideration (very practical
when you need fresh bread rolls on a Sunday morning!) and also allows you to
activate your own filters, such as "wheelchair-friendly", "dogs allowed" or
"organic".

The guide is not just suitable for vegetarians and vegans, but also for all
people who are trying to live their life in a greener and more animal friendly
way.

The app contains the following information:

* Over 200 restaurants, snack bars and takeaways with detailed descriptions
* 230 bakeries with a complete description of what is on offer
* A further 200 shopping possibilities in the area of cosmetics, groceries and organic produce
* More than 100 cafes with soy milk available
* A "vegan passport" with a detailed description for the staff at restaurants and hotels, the text for which has been kindly put together for us by the Vegan Society
.
