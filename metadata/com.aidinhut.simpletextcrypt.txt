Auto Name:SimpleTextCrypt
Summary:Encrypts plain text using AES256
Description:
'''Why another app?''' Most of the text encryption apps I found has had access
to the internet, and I couldn't trust them! Thus, I decided to write my own app.

'''Can You Trust it?''' This app is secure enough for i.e. sending messages to
your friends or encrypting your diaries. It uses AES in CBC mode with PKCS5
padding, which is very powerful encryption.

However, I'm not a security expert, so I don't recommend using this app for
serious data encryption.
