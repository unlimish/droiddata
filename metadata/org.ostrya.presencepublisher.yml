AutoName: Presence Publisher
Summary: Regularly publish to an MQTT topic
Description: |-
    This app regularly publishes to a configurable MQTT topic whenever
    connected to a given WiFi network. It can be used to integrate the presence
    of your phone in home automation.

    The app uses the built-in Android alarm manager, so notifications are sent
    even if the phone is in stand-by.

    '''Permissions'''
    * ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION: on Android 9+, necessary to retrieve SSID of
    connected WiFi (you do not need to grant the permission in Android
    6.0 - 8.1 for the app to work)
    * ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE: necessary to register network change listener
    * ACCESS_WIFI_STATE: necessary to retrieve SSID of connected WiFi
    * INTERNET: only necessary if your MQTT server is not running locally
    * FOREGROUND_SERVICE: necessary to send notifications
    * RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED: necessary to start service on start-up
