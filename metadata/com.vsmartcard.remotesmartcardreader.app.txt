Auto Name:Remote Smart Card Reader
Summary:Use your phone as NFC smart card reader
Description:
Use a host computer to use the smartphone's NFC hardware as contact-less
smartcard reader. On the host computer a special smart card driver, vpcd,
must be installed. The app establishes a connection to vpcd over the
network when a contact-less card is detected. Since vpcd integrates
seamlessly into the PC/SC framework of the host system, so the contact-less
card can be accessed by a typical smart card application, for example [https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC OpenSC].
