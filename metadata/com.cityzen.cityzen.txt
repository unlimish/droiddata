Summary:City navigation app
Description:
OpenStreetMap based city navigation app that helps you explore your city easily.
The app shows points of interest in different categories such as ATMs, gas
stations, drugstores, mobile phone stores etc. based on your location and it
does so without keeping your data. If you are an OSM contributor you can also
edit or add POIs directly from the app.
