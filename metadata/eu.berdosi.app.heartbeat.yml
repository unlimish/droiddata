Description: |-
    Simple way to estimate the heart rate. Please do not use it for medical purposes !

    This utility works by covering the flash as well as the device's camera with a finger, and waiting for 10 seconds. It works best when the person stays still, and the environment is dark.

    The phone analyzes the amount of red captured by the camera, and attempts to calculate the heart rate based on the subtle changes it detects.
