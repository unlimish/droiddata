Summary:GreenAddress client
Description:
GreenBits is a Bitcoin Wallet for Android provided by GreenAddress.

The wallet main strengths are security, privacy, easy of use and aims is to provide a
great user experience.

* It supports the payment protocol via both click and qrcode scanning and instant
  confirmation.
* Supports paper wallet scanning in both WIF and BIP38 format.
* Uses multisignature for improved security and per transaction two factor authentication.

Please note that another GreenAddress app is available for Android: it has more features
available however it consumes more resources and even on recent Android devices it may
not be as good of a user experience as this new Android native version. 

You can find it at [[it.greenaddress.cordova]].

Maintainer Notes:
scandelete libscrypt.so - it is built by F-Droid via prepare_fdroid.sh,
but it is still in GreenAddress repo for users who don't want to use NDK,
so it needs to be removed before building to pass scanning.
prebuild rm autobahn android jar - as above, still in repo for users who
don't want to be bothered with building Autobahn-SW from source.
