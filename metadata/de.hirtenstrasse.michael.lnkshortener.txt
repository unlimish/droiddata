Auto Name:LnkShortener
Summary:Shortens URL using the Polr API
Description:
With LnkShortener you can use your own [https://project.polr.me/ Polr]
installation in order to shorten any link. Share the link from chrome and you
will receive a shortened URL with the domain your Polr installation is running
under. From there you can share the link directly to other apps or copy it to
the clipboard.

The app is running out of the box with the [https://1n.pm/ 1n.pm URL] shortening
service. If you have your own Polr running simply enter your domain and API key
in the settings.
