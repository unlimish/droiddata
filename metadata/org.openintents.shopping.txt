Summary:Keep track of your shopping items
Description:
OI Shopping List is a powerful application which makes it easy to create and
manage checklists. OI Shopping List makes it easy to add items to a list, check
the item off, and remove it from the list.

The application can track separate prices for each store that you use, and
features a high level of customization. Font size, sort order, list columns, and
list cleanup behavior are all settings controlled by the user. All of these
features are brought together in a crisp layout that is customizable through a
variety of themes.
