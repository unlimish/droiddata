Description: |-
  MGit is a full featured Git client that allows you to manage files in a local Git repository, clone, push and pull to and from remote repositories.

  Features include:
  * Create local repositories
  * Clone remote repositories
  * Fetch, Pull, Push from remote repositories
  * Delete local repositories
  * Browse files
  * Browse commit messages
  * Checkout branches and tags
  * HTTP/HTTPS/SSH are supported (including SSH with private key passphrase)
  * Search local repositories
  * Privatekey management
  * git diff between commits
  * Import existing repositories
  * Merge branches
  * Add modified file to stage
  * View state of staged files (aka index)
  * Rebasing branches
  * Cherrypicks

  MGit does not have a built-in text editor but should also work well with other Android text editors that support Content Providers.

  MGit is a continuation of development of the popular SGit app.
