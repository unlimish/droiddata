Auto Name:NoteBuddy
Summary:Store encrypted notes
Description:
Take notes and encrypt them using password key derivation. The password will not
be stored to ensure security. When you delete the account, all notes will be
deleted automatically. Moreover, when one forgots the password, it should be
impossible to read the notes. In that case, it is needed to reinstall the app.

To use NoteBuddy, one must setup a simple user account (username and password
with more than five chars) in order to login. All settings are stored in
Android's Shared Preferences for now. The idea is to work with a SQlite database
on the long term.
