Auto Name:NoteBuddy
Summary:Store encrypted notes
Description:
Notes are encrypted using the AES Crypto library by Tozny LLC. Key generation,
encryption, and decryption are using 128-bit AES, CBC, PKCS5 padding, and a
random 16-byte IV with SHA1PRNG.

To use NoteBuddy, one must setup a simple user account (username and numerical
password) in order to login. Moreover, one may create a secret question in order
to gain access when the password is lost. All settings are stored encrypted in
Android's Shared Preferences for now. The idea is to work with a SQlite database
on the long term.
