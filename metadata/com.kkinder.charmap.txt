Auto Name:Charmap
Summary:Access unicode characters
Description:
A small and simple character picker, allowing you to copy and paste unicode characters,
from Arabic to Ethiopic Extended. To copy multiple characters, enable the editor.

Note, of course, that your deviceâ€™s font may not support all known characters.
Characters that your device cannot render will most likely show up as empty
rectangles, but they may still display elsewhere.
