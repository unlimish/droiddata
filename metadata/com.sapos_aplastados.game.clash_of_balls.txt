Auto Name:Clash of Balls
Summary:2-player accelerometer game
Description:
Prove your sensitive control skills and compete with your friends over WiFi in 
various levels. 
Try to destroy your rivals by pushing them into the black void and become the 
true master of balls. 
Don't forget to make use of the mighty power-ups that will appear eventually. 
And always be aware of the danger that you have to face out there. 
But remember, you are alone and there is only one survivor.

Games are played peer-to-peer; so
no server is used, but each player needs to be in the same network to see each
other. If the device supports it, Clash of Balls should also run via Bluetooth.
For the best game experience, the WiFi needs low latencies. 
You can also create a Hotspot and let others connect.

The aim of the game is to bounce the other players out of the field by balancing
your device.The game should be self-explanatory, there is a Help Menu. When the 
game starts and the countdown is shown, hold your device still in the desired 
position, where your ball should not move. During the game, tilt the device to 
move your player to a certain direction.

For physics simulation, JBox2D is used, a Java implementation of the 2D physics
engine Box2D.
