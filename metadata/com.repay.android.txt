Auto Name:Repay
Summary:Keep track of lended money
Description:
Lending money to your friends can get messy. You can lose track and have
disputes over it, or forget altogether. With Repay you can keep track of
everything you've lent them, and what they've lent you too using a simple,
fast system to store an IOU in your device so you never forget. There's no
need to make any accounts or give any bank account information, it's just
a simple record you keep to make sure you're never out of pocket.
