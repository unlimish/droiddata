When the app is launched, the user is prompted to enter the host name of his
e-venement instance as well as his login credentials wich will be stored for
future authentifications.

Once the form submitted, the app will connect to the instance's server and
display the access control page (tck.php/ticket/control), and tickets can be
controlled directly from there.

During use, the app will automatically re-authenticate the user on server
periodically to keep the session alive as long as needed.
