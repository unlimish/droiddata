AutoName: Jitsi Meet
Summary: Instant video conferences efficiently adapting to your scale
Description: |-
    Jitsi Meet lets you stay in touch with all your teams, be they family, friends,
    or colleagues. Instant video conferences, efficiently adapting to your scale.

    * Unlimited users: There are no artificial restrictions on the number of users
    or conference participants. Server power and bandwidth are the only limiting
    factors.
    * No account needed.
    * Lock-protected rooms: Control the access to your conferences with a password.
    * Encrypted by default.
    * High quality: Audio and video are delivered with the clarity and richness of
    Opus and VP8.
    * Web browser ready: No downloads are required of your friends to join the
    conversation. Jitsi Meet works directly within their browsers as well.
    Simply share your conference URL with others to get started.
    * 100% open source: Powered by awesome communities from all over the world.
    And your friends at Atlassian.
    * Invite by pretty URLs: You can meet at the easy to remember
    https://MySite.com/OurConf of your choice instead of joining the hard to
    remember rooms with seemingly random sequences of numbers and letters in their
    names.

    (Warning: when using a Jitsi Meet instance, your stream is encrypted on the
    network but decrypted on the machine that hosts the bridge.
    See [https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/409#issuecomment-355406112]
