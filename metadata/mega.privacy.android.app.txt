Auto Name:MEGA
Summary:A client to access MEGA Cloud Storage
Description:
Mega is a cloud storage and file hosting service produced by Mega Limited. The
New Zealand-based website was launched on January 19, 2013 by Kim Dotcom. Mega
mobile apps are available for Windows Phone, Android, BlackBerry OS and iOS.
Mega most notably advertises its feature that all files are encrypted locally
before they are uploaded.

The official source code of the app contains binary blobs, so this tracks a fork
which builds those from source. Hence, versions might become available with a
certain lag.
