Auto Name:F-Droid Privileged Extension
Summary:Help F-Droid acquire system privileges
Description:
'''Note:''' F-Droid will need root privileges to install this app as a system
app.

[[org.fdroid.fdroid]] can make use of system privileges or permissions to
install, update and remove applications on its own. The only way to obtain those
privileges is to become a system app.

This is where the Privileged Extension comes in - being a separate app and much
smaller, it can be installed as a system app and communicate with the main app
via AIDL IPC.

This has several advantages:

* Reduced disk usage in the system partition
* System updates don't remove F-Droid
* The process of installing into system via root is safer

Instead of this build, most users will want to install the "Over-The-Air" (OTA)
update zip file is called [[org.fdroid.fdroid.privileged.ota]].
.
