Summary:Nintendo console emulator
Description:
Dolphin is a Gamecube, Wii and Triforce (the arcade machine based on the Gamecube) emulator which 
supports many extra features and abilities not present on the original consoles. Gamecube and Wii 
compatibility is good - one can expect "mainstream" titles to run; lesser known titles can be hit or 
miss. Triforce compatibility is currently limited to a couple of games - others require more of the 
Triforce-specific peripheral devices to be emulated.

Desktop version of emulator, even when running on modern hardware, is known to have performance issues 
with many games, so don't expect Android port to be well-playable even on top-class device with OpenGL 
ES 3.0 support (the later is mandatory for hardware accelerated emulation). Work on devices with 
512MB/1GB of RAM is not guranteed. See forum for details:
