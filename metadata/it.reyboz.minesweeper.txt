Auto Name:MineSweeper
Summary:Clear minefield without detonating a mine
Description:
Simple one-tap strategy game where you have a virtual minefield and you must
liberate it. If you play tapping randomly in the field probably your penguin
will become a good petard, otherwise you and your cute penguin are probably
destined to survive.

Tips:
* When you see any number pay much attention: There are exactly "n" bombs around that number!
* Hold-tap to place flags.

Permissions:
Every permission of this app (with exception of Vibration and Audio permissions) are automatically inserted by Cordova during the build process and are not really used for any purpose.

Anti-features:
Has been inserted an easter egg in the language section.

Maintainer Notes:
This app is intentionally created exclusively in HTML5, CSS and Javascript,
with Cordova/PhoneGap. So this app is potentially multiplatform, and if you know
how to bring this application on other platforms you are free to do so, and please do so!
Please, before you want to improve this app, read the [http://minesweeper.reyboz.it/minesweeper/README.txt README] file.
