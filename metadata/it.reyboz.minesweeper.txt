Summary:A classic game for explosive people
Description:
If you don't know what this game is, you are probably a bad person.
MineSweeper (or Open MineSweeper) is a simple one-tap strategy game where you have a minefield and you must liberate it. If you play tapping randomly in the field probably your penguin will become a good petard, otherwise you and your cute penguin are probably destined to survive.
Hurry up, watch out: I do not like exploding penguins.

Tips:
* When you see any number pay much attention: There are exactly "n" bombs around that number! Hold-tap to place flags.
* Hold-tap for a flag!
Have fun!
