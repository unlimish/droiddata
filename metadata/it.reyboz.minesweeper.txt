Auto Name:MineSweeper
Summary:Clear minefield without detonating a mine.
Description:
Simple one-tap strategy game where you have a virtual minefield and you must
liberate it. If you play tapping randomly in the field probably your penguin
will become a good petard, otherwise you and your cute penguin are probably
destined to survive.

Tips:
* When you see any number pay much attention: There are exactly "n" bombs around that number!
* Hold-tap to place flags.
