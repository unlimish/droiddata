Name:Telecine
Summary:Record full-resolution video
Description:
Capture full resolution videos directly on your phone. No more recording
controls cluttering up the video or USB debugging notification in your status
bar! Launch the overlay and then navigate away from the app. The overlay will
remain allowing you to press record when you are in the target app. The overlay
disappears while recording. To stop, press the area where the overlay used to be
(hint: it's still there! just transparent)

TL;DR: Press record, press the same area to stop.
