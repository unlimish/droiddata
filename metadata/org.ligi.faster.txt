Name:FASTer App Search Tool
Auto Name:FAST App Search Tool
Summary:Find apps just by typing
Description:
Find your apps without needing to scroll through lists. It can display icons or
not and search for package names too if the option is selected. Long-pressing an
entry can display options to view the App Details, which is helpful for
uninstalling apps, or to view the app on Google Play. Works as a normal app or a
launcher. This is the smaller variant (no translations and extras) - if you do
not care that much for space you might want to install FAST.
