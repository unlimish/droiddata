Summary:Keep track of your grades
Description:
Allows students to simply and easily track their grades. Create classes and add
grades for each of those classes. Each grade is created with a name and the
point value it holds. With this you can calculate the percentage and overall
grade for each class. Gradr also allows students to automatically predict how
many points they need on their next assignment to get the grade that they desire.
