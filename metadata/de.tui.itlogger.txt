Summary:Measure road quality
Description:
Log and evaluate data from your smartphone and OBD (onboard diagnostics).
iTLogger is the result of a software project at Ilmenau University of Technology
in 2012. Its aim was to create an app and corresponding desktop program (in the
same code repository), so that people could track their journey on forest roads
and later evaluate the data on their desktop. With the logged data you can
evaluate the quality of forest roads.
