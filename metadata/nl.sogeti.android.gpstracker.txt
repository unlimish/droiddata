Auto Name:Open GPS Tracker
Summary:GPS Logger
Description:
An app to record the path you've taken. OpenStreetMap can be used as a map
provider by changing
one of the settings and tracks can by uploaded to OSM from within the app.

Anti-feature: Dependencies. It's necessary for Google Maps to be already
installed either as an app or as a shared system library for this app to be
installable. We will be able to remove this dependency as soon as we
figure out how to build the app from source.
