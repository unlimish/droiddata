AutoName: Voodoo Audio Measurements Player
Summary: Make audio measurements
Description: |-
    Little app that plays RMAA and udial samples to ease Android devices sound
    performance measurements.

    In order to complete measurements, connect your phone or tablet
    headphone/line-out JACK to a computer with a high quality soundcard line-in then
    record the output manually.

    By using this app instead of playing samples through a vendor or third-party
    music player you can be sure no signal processing is done by the player.

    If the manufacturer adds audio effects, youâ€™ll be able to spot them with
    confidence through measurement.

    Without additional (like SRS, Beats audio) processing and if digital volume is
    maxed out, DAC will be fed by un-altered PCM data.

    Measurement accuracy tips:

    * Ensure any re-sampling is disabled on your computer by setting sample frequencies to 44100 Hz.
    * Record using the maximum resolution (in general, 24bit) of your sound card's ADC.
    * Run your device on battery, not plugged on charger or USB.
    * Take care of using appropriate and consistent input and output levels.
