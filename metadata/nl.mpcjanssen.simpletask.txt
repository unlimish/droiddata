Auto Name:Simpletask
Summary:Todo list manager
Description:
A simple task list manager that strives to have just enough features to do GTD
(the Getting Things Done methodology), but no more. 
Based on the [http://todotxt.com todo.txt] app so all info is stored in a
single text file called todo.txt.
Note that, with this version, you will need to take care of backups yourself.

*Todo list stored in the documented todo.txt format
*Comprehensive filtering and multi sort
*Create calendar reminders for specific tasks directly from the app
*Select on or more tasks and press overflow menu->Add reminder
*Share the complete tasklist or selected tasks using the Android share feature
*Tasks can deferred into the future. Combined with the "Creation date in future" sort it allows you to get tasks out of your face (as in 1MTD/MYN)
.
