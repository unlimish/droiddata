Auto Name:Muzei
Summary:Live wallpaper of famous art
Description:
Muzei is a live wallpaper that gently refreshes your home screen each day with
famous works of art. It also recedes into the background, blurring and dimming
artwork to keep your icons and widgets in the spotlight. Simply double touch the
wallpaper or open the Muzei app to enjoy and explore the artwork in its full
glory.

Alternatively, you can choose your favorite photos from your own gallery or
other apps to use on your home screen. To keep your wallpaper fresh, Muzei will
rotate through your favorite photos every few hours.

Maintainer Notes:
Custom version format, so no UCM applies.

Since 2.0, source code needs to be patched to get rid of Google Play Services.
The "wearable" and "example-watchface" components should be removed
completely, the rest of the code has to be cleaned up from FirebaseAnalytics.
