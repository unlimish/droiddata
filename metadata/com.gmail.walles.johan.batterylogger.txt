Auto Name:Battery Logger
Summary:Log and plot battery drain
Description:
Log and plot battery drain speed up to one month back. The plot will include
markers for when things like app or OS upgrades have happened. The idea then is
that using this information it should be possible to find out what makes battery
usage increase.
