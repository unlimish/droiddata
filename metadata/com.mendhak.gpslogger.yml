AutoName: GPSLogger
Description: |-
    GPSLogger uses the GPS capabilities of your device to log coordinates to a GPX
    or KML file at regular intervals. This can be particularly useful if you want to
    geotag your photos after a day out or share your travel route with someone. The
    purpose of this application is to save you battery power when abroad and to last
    as long as possible.

    Can log to GPX, KML, CSV, NMEA and CSV formats. Can also log to a custom URL or just the screen.

    Automatically upload or email the file at set intervals to destinations such as Email, FTP/SFTP, Dropbox, OpenStreetMap.
