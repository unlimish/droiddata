Auto Name:Acquiring location
Summary:Share your location
Description:
Share your location via any of the messaging apps you have installed.

N.B It isn't possible to view your position on a map because Google Maps is the only map source and
f-droid can't supply an API key to use it. If you need to use Google Maps install the developer's build
from the website.
