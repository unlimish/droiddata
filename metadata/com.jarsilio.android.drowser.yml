AutoName: Drowser
Summary: Simple background app killer
Description: |-
    Avoid rogue apps from running in the background with Drowser.

    Drowser is a simple app that kills the selected apps when the screen turns off.

    It requires root and uses it to kill the apps with an 'am force-stop <app-id>'. This is a ''very'' impolite way of stopping apps. These might (and will probably) misbehave. You might also lose data because of this. '''Beware!'''

RequiresRoot: 'yes'
