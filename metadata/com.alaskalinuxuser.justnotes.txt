Auto Name:Just Notes
Summary:Take notes
Description:
This is a no frills, simple, easy to use note taking application for those times
that you just want to get straight to the point. Make and take notes, as well as
save and delete old notes. A confirmation box will open before you delete a note
to make sure that you really want to get rid of it.

apps and "small" apps for easy to understand and usable code.
