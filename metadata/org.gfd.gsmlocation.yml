Name: GSMLocationNlpBackend
AutoName: GSMLocationBackend
Summary: UnifiedNlp location provider (OpenCellID)
Description: |-
    [[com.google.android.gms]] backend that uses [http://opencellid.org OpenCellID].

    Location calculation is done onboard and works without network connectivity. The
    cell-tower based lookup for your current location is implemented via a included
    binary cell database extracted from [http://opencellid.org OpenCellID].

    This "NetworkLocationProvider" works without network connectivity and will never
    post your data anywhere. You are thus encouraged to help OpenCellID to gather
    more cells in order to improve this project.

    [[de.enaikoon.android.keypadmapper3]] can be used to gather cell information for
    OpenCellID.
