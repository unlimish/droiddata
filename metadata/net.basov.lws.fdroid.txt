Auto Name:lWS
Summary:lightweight Web Server (lWS)
Description:
'''It is ...'''

* ... Web Server for static content.
* ... lightweight. APK size less then 100 Kb.
* ... as simple as possible. Only essential features implemented.
* ... open. [Source code](https://github.com/mvbasov/lWS") released under GPL-3.0.
* ... personal solution. It is not optimized/tested for many parallel connections and large file transfer.
* ... network state responsive. Require WiFi connected or tethering enabled. Service stop automatically if network disconnected.

'''Based on'''

This application is continue of development [Webserver for
Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bolutions.webserver)
which is [open source](https://github.com/bodeme/androidwebserver) and released
under GPL-3.0.

'''What is configurable'''

* Document root. Path may be entered as text or optional select using OI File Manager. If it is not installed offer to install it.
* Port. May be from 1024 to 65535. Default is 8080

In attempt to set wrong value parameter automatically set to default.

'''Document root'''

Document root by default set to application private directory. Example index
file automatically created. It is safe configuration. You can place your pages
in this directory. But be carefully! If you use Android 5.0 or above and
deinstall the application this directory and it's content will be removed.

'''Security warning'''

You can change document root to any readable point of file system, but you need
to understand what are you doing. __Be careful: you could (suddenly?) create the
configuration so way, than anyone on the same WiFi network could access to the
data on your device either you don't like it.__ All files from document root and
below available for reading without any restrictions to anyone who connected to
network and known URL of the server.

'''"Send", "QR code" and "Browser"'''

After server starts you can press:

* "Browser" button for check server operation in local browser.
* "QR code" to call [lWS QR plugin](https://f-droid.org/app/net.basov.lws.qr.fdroid) or [Barcode Scanner (by ZXing Team)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android) to share URL by QR code. If nothing of both installed offer to install lWS QR plugin
* "Send" to share working server URL to another device by Bluetooth, Android Beam, E-Mail and other way available on your device.

'''On screen log'''

The application has no permanent logging. I treat this as redundant
functionality. I doing my best to make notification actual all time. On screen
log actual only then application visible. Log screen may be cleared after
returning from background.
