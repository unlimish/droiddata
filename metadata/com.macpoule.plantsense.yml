Summary: Read the soil moisture of your plants
Description: |-
    Plant Sense is the companion app for the Arduino project of
    the same name to measure the soil moisture of your plants.

    Why? To know whether the plant is thirsty.

    The hardware transmits soil moisture, and ambient temperature/humidity
    via Bluetooth. The app connects to the Bluetooth and displays the
    latest readings.

    Consult https://github.com/reaper47/plant-sense for instructions on
    how to set up the hardware.
