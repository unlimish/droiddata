Auto Name:SecDroid
Summary:Secure your device from attacks
Description:
SecDroid hardens the android kernel by disable certain binaries that have
internet access or can be used as an attack vector and by securing the TCP
Stack using Systctl. This helps prevent some MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) and
Spoofing attacks. It may also prevent some DOS (Denial-Of-Service) Attacks.

Disabled services include SSH, SSHD, Telnet NC (net cat), and Ping, to keep
others from gaining access to your device via a remote terminal. SecDroid also
disables Package Manager so that no apps can be installed remotely to your
device (you can still install them from Market or using APK files directly on
the device itself). Lastly, it also allows you to disable ADBD (the ADB
service running on the device that allows you to connect to it through command
line from a remote computer) until the next reboot.
