Auto Name:Duck Duck Go
Summary:DuckDuckGo search provider
Description:
'''N.B''' This isn't related to the official DuckDuckGo app.

Integrates the search engine DuckDuckGo with the Android OS. It adds another web
search provider to the system and some neat suggestions for the user.

There is an option to use DDG in the CyanogenMod 10 browser (depending on the
locale), and also in [[org.tint]].

[[org.mozilla.firefox]] allows you make search engines by long-pressing any
input field.
