AutoName: Simple Cleanup
Description: |-
    Extremely simple cleanup app! Doesnâ€™t need internet, one button solution!

    <i>Simple Cleanup</i> deletes files according to the space needed in your phone.

    * At 20% space free, it deletes old WhatsApp backups and Tencent cache, in that order, until it gets to >20%.
    * At 10% space free it deletes the last WhatsApp backup, old media (> 1 mo. old) and then all media, in that order.

    <i>Simple Cleanup</i> checks file by file until enough space would be free.

    <i>Simple Cleanup</i> checks in the background and alerts you if you are
    running low on free space.

    Note: currently only WhatsApp folders are checked. More might be added in
    the future.

    <i>Simple Cleanup</i> is always accepting recommendations and adding features!
