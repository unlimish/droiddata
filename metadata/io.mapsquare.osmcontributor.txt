Summary:OpenStreetMap Contributor Mapping Tool
Description:
The Openstreetmap Contributor app allows anyone to contribute to OSM. It enables
those-who-know to easily manage a group of newbies as the contribution process
is intuitive and easy. The App comes in three flavours: store (for the Android
Store version), poi-storage (for MapSquare POI Databases), and template (for the
osm.mapsquare.io tool for Mapping parties). Bring your MapParties to a whole new
level!
