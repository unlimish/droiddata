Auto Name:pressureNET
Summary:Android-powered barometer network
Description:
pressureNET uses sensors in Android devices to collect live data about the
atmosphere. The app runs periodically in the background to measure atmospheric
pressure (via onboard barometer) and location, which it then stores and sends to
pressureNET servers. This live data is relayed directly to researchers who are
working to improve weather forecasting.

This app is built using the open source pressureNET SDK, which does much of the
heavy-lifting for periodic data collection and transmission.
