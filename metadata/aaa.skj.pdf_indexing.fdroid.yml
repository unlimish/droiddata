Summary: Advance Document Organizer
Description: |-
    PDFi is an Advance Document Organizer
    Import PDFs/XLSXs in the App once, then you can search these PDFs/XLSXs from:
    file name, PDFs's first page text / XLSXs's sheets data and Custom Tags.
    
    When you get lots of PDF files daily/weekly form different sources like:
    email, social media or simple downloading it.

    And you have to remeber the Name and where that PDF is saved or who sent it.

    PDFi solve the problem, you just have to import the PDF in the App once,
    You then search PDFs within the app from their filename, text content
    and you can also give custom tags to any PDF file.
    It saved hours of finding the pdf you need.

    PDFi supports:
      * pdf
      * xlsx
    
    PDFi is for Shop Owners, Insurance Agent, Student, Professor, or anyone with lots of PDFs
