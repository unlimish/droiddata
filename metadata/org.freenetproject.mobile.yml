    # FAQ

    - Will there ever be an iOS version? Is it even possible?

    Apparently it's technically possible. We're not sure we'll focus our efforts on it right now.

    - Wouldn't that be a huge battery drain? What about data-plan?

    The app is pre-configured to keep battery and network data usage to a minimum. You can configure the app to avoid data-plan use as well.

    - Can I use the app on my everyday phone?

    Yes, you can. Configure it to "preserve data", so it only connects on Wifi and "preserve battery" to run only when charging.

    - Does it run on my Android X, Y, Z phone?

    The application runs on Android Lollipop 5.1 and above. So any modern phone should work.

    - What can I do with it?

    You can access and create content on Freenet. Access FMS Archive to see what the Freenet community is talking about.
