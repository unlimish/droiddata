Summary: Share your location
Description: |-
  A simple way of sharing your location via a widget. You can send a message
  containing a link to a map of your current location via any standard registered
  sharing application. For example, an SMS message.

  The recipient is sent a link to a web page that displays the location on a
  Google map, though the app itself uses OSM. (The source for the web service is
  in the same repository as the client).

  Anti-Feature:UpstreamNonFree - Newer versions of this app require Google Play
  Services, so there will not be any further updates in our repos.
