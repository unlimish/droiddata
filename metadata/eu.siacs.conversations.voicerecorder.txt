Auto Name:Voice Recorder Plugin
Summary:Send audio messages via Conversations
Description:
Note: As of Conversations 2.2.0 this functionality is integrated in the main app

This simple voice recorder can be used to send voice messages from within
Conversations, an XMPP client. It is more straightforward than using Android's
built-in or the vendor's voice recording UIs.
