Summary:Decode data URIs in QR codes
Description:
It's possible to embed small amount of media (like audioclips or javascript
games) physically on paper as 2d QR barcodes. This is unlike current usage
of QR codes, where it is normally used to just store plaintext or urls or
contacts.

1. First objective is to decode data URIs sent in via intent from a scanner
like [[com.google.zxing.client.android]] or from a NFC tag reader.

2. Secondary objective, is that for larger files, you want to spread it over
multiple QR codes. So we'll need a way to read all these tags an then join it
together.

Only the first part is done at the moment.
