Auto Name:PGPAuth
Summary:Send PGP-verified requests
Description:
This app sends GPG-verified requests over the internet to a given server.

Currently there are the actions open and close, but request-type will be configurable.
The request also includes a timestamp to verify the request is sent by the owner of the gpg-key and is not sent again by someone else.

It is used in the ChaosChemnitz hackerspace in Germany to open and close the door without the need of a "real" key.

You'll need [[org.thialfihar.android.apg]] to sign requests.
