Summary: (one sentence, no more than 30-40 chars)
Description:
This app sends GPG-verified requests over the internet to a given server.

Currently there are the actions open and close, but request-type will be configurable.
The request also includes a timestamp to verify the request is sent by the owner of the gpg-key and not resent by someone else.

It is used in our Hackerspace ChaosChemnitz (Germany) to open and close the door without the need of a “real” key.

This app requires [[org.thialfihar.android.apg]] to sign your requests with GPG.

Requires Root: No
