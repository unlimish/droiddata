AutoName: Private Location
Description: |-
    A simple app to set your location to anywhere in the world, and improve
    general phone location privacy.

    Apps on your phone can require location permissions to work, and make
    repeated and unnecessary location requests in the background throughout
    the day.

    Setting your location somewhere else will help protect your privacy when
    using these apps.

    This is one of the few location apps that doesn't rely on Google Maps.
