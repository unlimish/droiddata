AutoName: Private Location
Description: |-
  <b>Note:</b> This app is no longer developed

  A simple app to set your location to anywhere in the world, and improve general phone location privacy.
  This app will fake/spoof both your GPS and network location on your phone.

  Many apps on your phone won't work without location permissions, and can make repeated and unnecessary location requests in the background throughout the day.
  Setting your location somewhere else will help to mitigate that and protect your privacy.

  The open-source Leaflet map library along with Wikimedia to provide map tiles are used in place of Google Maps.
