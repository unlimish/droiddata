Summary:Classic game remake
Description:
Smash all the bricks by directing the ball at them. The best way to control
the paddle is to glide your finger across the top of the screen.

N.B. The app is written in Qt so you need to install the Ministro app before running
this. If the Qt libraries are not already present Ministro will fetch them.

This app requires the Necessitas SDK to build
.
