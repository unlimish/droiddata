Auto Name:WiFi Backend
Name:LocalWifiNlpBackend
Summary:UnifiedNlp location provider (local WiFi database)
Description:
[https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp UnifiedNlp] backend 
that uses locally acquired WiFi AP data to resolve user location.

This backend consists of two parts sharing a common database. One part 
passively monitors the GPS. If the GPS has acquired and has a good position 
accuracy, then the WiFi APs detected by the phone are stored.

The other part is the actual location provider which uses the database to 
estimate location when the GPS is not available or has not yet gotten its first 
fix. The use of stored WiFi AP can dramatically decrease the GPS time to first 
fix.

This backend performs no network data. All data acquired by the phone stays on 
the phone and no queries are made to a centralized AP location provider.
