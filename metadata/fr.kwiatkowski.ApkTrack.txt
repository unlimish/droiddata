Auto Name:ApkTrack
Summary:Check for updates on PlayStore
Description:
Periodically checks if your installed apps can be updated.

It was created for users who don't use the Google Play Store, but still need
to know when new APKs are available for their apps. ApkTrack performs simple
website scraping to grab the latest versions of packages present on the device.

Note that the update checks don't care whether you are using 3G, 4G or WiFi.
Please do not install it if your mobile plan charges data at a premium. Also,
you have to manually refresh you app list from time to time.
