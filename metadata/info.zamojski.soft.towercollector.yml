AutoName: Tower Collector
Summary: Join the community and collect cell towers locations from your area
Description: |-
    Tower Collector gives you opportunity to contribute in OpenCellID.org and
    Mozilla Location Services projects by uploading GPS locations of
    GSM/UMTS/LTE/CDMA cell towers from your area. The measurements help map
    the extent of mobile phone network coverage. You can use the app to collect
    data for personal purposes and export them to CSV or GPX files.
    Some features:
    * specially optimized GPS parameters to reduce battery drain
    * upload to OpenCellID.org and Mozilla Location Services (MLS) projects
    * export to SD card as CSV or GPX
    * ad-free, forever!

    The OpenCellID.org project goal is to create a worldwide open source
    database of mobile cell locations. Tower Collector gives you opportunity to
    contribute in OpenCellID project by uploading cell towers locations from
    your area. Collected data can be used to quickly locate devices without
    enabling GPS.

    Mozilla Location Services (MLS) is an open source project, aiming to create
    a worldwide database of wireless network infrastructure identifiers (cell
    towers, WiFi access points, Bluetooth beacons) correlated with GPS
    locations. Aggregated cell location set is available under the public
    domain "Creative Commons (CC-0)" license.
