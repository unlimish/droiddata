Description:
This package has been deprecated in favour of the original [[com.fsck.k9]],
since we are now able to build stable releases from source. Please switch to
that one.

You will be able to easily export your settings and then import them again,
without needing to reconfigure anything. To access the import/export
functionalities, navigate out of your folders and accounts via the Home button
on the ActionBar, i.e. the K9 logo at the top left corner of the screen. In
there, you should find the options in the menu.
