Auto Name:Kolab Notes
Summary:Write notes and sync them with Kolab
Description:
Take notes locally and optionally sync them with Kolab and IMAP servers in
the Kolab v3 storage format.

The goal of the app is, to support the full stack of Kolab Notes
functionality: notebooks and tags for organising notes is already possible.
Also it is possible to edit the classification and color of a note. At the
moment it can interpret rich text, but it is not possible to format the text
within the app (this feature and support for attachments will be integrated
in a future release).

There are already 2 types of widgets included in the app. One widget is a
kind of a "sticky note" widget, it displays the summary and description of
a single note. The other widget is a configureable list widget.
