Auto Name:ODK Collect
Summary:Data collection tools
Description:
Sample blank surveys can be downloaded within the app.

Open Data Kit (ODK) is a cross-platform set of tools which help organizations author,
field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. ODK provides an out-of-the-box solution for users to:

* Build a data collection form or survey;
* Collect the data on a mobile device and send it to a server; and
* Aggregate the collected data on a server and extract it in useful formats.

In addition to socio-economic and health surveys with GPS locations and images, ODK is being used to
create decision support for clinicians and for building multimedia-rich nature mapping tools. See
featured deployments and list of tools for more examples of what the ODK community is doing. We welcome
and encourage participation from the user community.

Status: The app is including proprietary google play libraries.
