AutoName: Headwind MDM
Description: |-
  A Powerful Open Source Platform to Manage your Enterprise Android Devices

  * Quick and Easy to Install “Out of the Box”
  * Compatible with Most Android Devices
  * Manages Devices in Closed Private Networks
  * Premium: All Must-Have MDM Features

  Scaling of your business requires proper management. The MDM
  software is a smart manager of your enterprise tablets, smartphones,
  kiosks, and digital signage systems. It’s particularly useful to
  manage unattended devices, replacing hours of maintenance work by a
  few mouse clicks!

  * Group-based policy management forces hundreds of devices to work
  in the same way, thus making business processes clearer and
  easier.

  * Device status control makes it easy to find problems with
  enterprise devices and take actions to fix them in a timely
  manner.

  * Remote support simplifies the IT manager’s work to resolve issues
  and correct faults.

  Headwind MDM requires registration on a Headwind MDM server.  You
  can deploy your own (https://h-mdm.com/download/) or try the demo
  (https://srv.h-mdm.com). See the Headwind MDM documentation for more
  information.
