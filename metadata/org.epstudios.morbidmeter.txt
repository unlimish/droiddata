Auto Name:MorbidMeter
Summary:Life expectancy widget
Description:
Morbid Meter is a widget that puts your time on earth into perspective. Choose
a life-expectancy and a timescale and the widget will display how much of that
timescale you have already lived. The default is years, so that will show what
month of the year it is, so to speak. Choose it to be reversed, with seconds,
and it will show you how many more seconds you can be expected to live for.
