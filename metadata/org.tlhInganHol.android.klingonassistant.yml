Summary: Lexicon dictionary for the Klingon language
Description: "tlhIngan Hol boQwI' / Klingon Language Assistant is a lexicon dictionary,\
    \ canon search tool, and grammar analyser for the Klingon language ({tlhIngan\
    \ Hol}) devised by Marc Okrand for Star Trek's warrior race, and spoken by characters\
    \ on The Big Bang Theory and Star Trek: Discovery. It can parse Klingon grammar\
    \ and serve as an aid in Klingon-to-English translation. However, it is NOT a\
    \ general-purpose English-to-Klingon translator. You will need to know some Klingon\
    \ already to make use of it for that purpose."
