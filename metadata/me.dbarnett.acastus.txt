Summary:A privacy focused address / POI lookup tool
Description:
Acastus relies on Pelias as the backend, a replacement for Google Maps and other
geocoding  services that you can run on your own server. It uses the pelias-api
to fetch results to your phone, allowing you to search for places in Acastus.
Then open and navigate to the  result in your preffered navigation app, such as
OsmAnd or Maps.me.
