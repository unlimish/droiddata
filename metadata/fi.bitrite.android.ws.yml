Name: WarmShowers
Summary: A Community of Bicycle Tourists and Those Who Support Them
Description: |-
    The Warm Showers Community is a free worldwide hospitality exchange for
    touring cyclists. People who are willing to host touring cyclists sign up
    and provide their contact information, and may occasionally have someone
    stay with them and share great stories and a drink. All members agree to
    host others either now or in the future, but for some members hosting may
    be in years or even decades in their future.

    Members of Warmshowers.org can use this app to find hosts using both map and
    textual search interfaces. Hosts can be contacted directly through the app.
    Host information can also be downloaded and stored for offline usage.
    For more information on Warm Showers please

    version, what device and the specific issue you're having.
