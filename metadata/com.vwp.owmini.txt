Name:OpenWLANMini
Auto Name:MiniOpenWLANMap@Android
Summary:Help create a WiFi coverage map
Description:
For use in location services when no GPS is available (similar like Google
does but free and open and with an option to unsubscribe).
OpenWLANMini@Android is an as small and slim as possible App that helps to
collect WLANs and their positions and where users take part at a tracing
contest. This App is limited to the minimal functionality that is required to
do this job but does not come with additional features like a live map.
