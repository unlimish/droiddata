Auto Name:Network Monitor
Summary:Check network connectivity
Description:
Network Monitor is a diagnostic tool which periodically tests your network
connection and logs the results to a database on the phone. It tests the
connection by retrieving the main Google page ([https://www.google.com]) in two
different ways:

* An HTTP connection (the type of connection used by the browser and other web apps)
* A basic socket connection (a type of connection used by other apps)

It also logs other information about your device and connection status, such as:

* The network type (WiFi, mobile/EDGE, mobile/HSPA, etc)
* The WiFi SSID or APN
* The device's location (latitude, longitude)
* The cell tower's ids
* The signal strength (from 0 to 4)
* Other information...

You can send yourself a report of the collected data, in several formats (Excel,
CSV, HTML, KML, the raw database). The report will also contain a summary of the
success rate of the connection tests, per cell tower and WiFi access point.

* WARNING: This app is a diagnostic/debugging app which may use a lot of battery and data.
