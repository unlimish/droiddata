Summary:A flexible, complete and handy dice roller
Description:
Quick Dice Roller is an app made for the tabletop RPG Geek. It allows to 
emulate almost all the complex dice rolls required by RPG and board games.

The dice can be added at will and organized in dice bags. Each die is defined 
by a formula such as "2d6+5" as well as special functions like "rak(1d6,4,3)" 
that allow to emulates the most complex game systems. An handy formulas 
builder simplifies the process, and allow to access to an online help. Check 
the [http://goo.gl/mZkcQS list of all supported functions].

Thanks to "named values", as well as keep track of games scores, you can 
define formulas using variable parameters. You can create, for example, the 
named value "Level" with label "lvl", then use the formula "(lvl)d6" to 
determine the fireball damage. So when your mage level up you don't need to 
edit the formula: just change the "Level" value!
