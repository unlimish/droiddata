Auto Name:Quick Dice Roller
Summary:Flexible, complete and handy dice roller
Description:
Emulate almost all the complex dice rolls required by RPG and board games.

The dice can be added at will and organized in dice bags. Each die is defined
by a formula such as "2d6+5" as well as special functions like "rak(1d6,4,3)"
that allow to emulates the most complex game systems. An handy formulas
builder simplifies the process, and allow to access to an online help. Check
the [http://goo.gl/mZkcQS list of all supported functions].

Thanks to "named values", as well as keep track of games scores, you can
define formulas using variable parameters. You can create, for example, the
named value "Level" with label "lvl", then use the formula "(lvl)d6" to
determine the fireball damage. So when your mage level up you don't need to
edit the formula: just change the "Level" value!
