Summary:Update custom Chromium for Snapdragon builds
Description:
Automatically update an unofficial build of
[https://www.codeaurora.org/projects/all-active-projects/chromium-browser-snapdragon
Code Aurora's Chromium for Snapdragon], an optimized fork targeting Qualcomm's
Snapdragon processors.

The custom build aims to deploy the stock Chromium SWE with only few additions:
custom icon, custom name, adblock, more search engines.

This app will search a third-party GitHub repo
[https://github.com/bamless/chromium-swe-builds] for new custom builds once a
day, and will show a notification if one is found.
