Auto Name:Kill Camera
Summary:Kill camera related processes
Description:
Kill camera related processes. This is useful when you get the famous error
message "Can't connect to camera" or similar. You tap on KILL button. Once the
camera service killed, it should be automatically restarted by the system. So
you don't need to restart your device just to take a photo and therefor loose
the opportunity!
