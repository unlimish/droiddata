Name: LibreCHovid
Summary: COVID-19 tracing client for Switzerland
Description: |-
    LibreCHovid is a fork of the official <a
    href="https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/swisscovid-app-und-contact-tracing.html">SwissCovid</a>
    contact tracing app for Switzerland. It does not rely on the proprietary
    Google-Apple Exposure Notification framework, but uses instead the
    compatible microG free implementation. It will therefore run on devices
    without Google Mobile Services.

    The functionality of the application is the same as the original. However,
    as it does not have the privileges granted to GMS, its ability to run
    reliably in the background may be affected. Our internal tests have shown
    it to behave well on various systems, but your mileage may vary.

    Please note that this fork is <b>not supported by the Swiss
    authorities</b>.

MaintainerNotes: |-
    There is a lint error during the build phase that has not yet been worked out.
    It is currently ignored and should have no consequence on the app.
