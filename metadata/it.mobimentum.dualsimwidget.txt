Auto Name:DualSim Reminder
Summary:Tools for dual SIM devices from Samsung
Description:
Intended for dual SIM Samsung phones: it won't (probably) work on
different brands and will be useless on single SIM phones. The two
features of the app are:

* Set an alarm that reminds you to enable/disable SIM at scheduled times, e.g. for working times.
* Add a homescreen widget that lets you open Dual SIM settings directly.
