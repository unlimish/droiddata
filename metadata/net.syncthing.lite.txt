Auto Name:Syncthing Lite
Summary:File synchronization
Description:
This project is an Android app, that works as a client for a Syncthing share
(accessing Syncthing devices in the same way a client-server file sharing app
accesses its proprietary server).

This is a client-oriented implementation, designed to work online by downloading
and uploading files from an active device on the network (instead of
synchronizing a local copy of the entire repository). This is quite different
from the way the syncthing-android works, and its useful from those devices that
cannot or wish not to download the entire repository (for example, mobile
devices with limited storage available, wishing to access a syncthing share).
