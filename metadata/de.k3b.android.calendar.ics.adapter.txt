Name:Calendar ICS adapter
Auto Name:android.calendar.ics.adapter
Summary:Import and export .ics/.ical calendar file entries.
Description:
Helper that opens *.ics or *.ical files or attachments of type text/calendar and 
displays the "Add to calendar" dialog pre-populated. 

It also supports exporting calendar entries, either
as a file or as an attachment. 

'''Status:''' 
* Works with android 4.0 and up. 
  * Should work with most android 2.1 and up but it is not garanteed, since there was no standard calender api before android 4.0.
* Works with k9-mail [[com.fsck.k9]] to import and export calender-events via ics-file-attachments.
* Works with "send to bluetooth"
* Does not work with "receive bluetooth" because android blocks receiving "*.ics" files. 
  * As a workaround you can receive "*.ical" files via bluetooth that can be imported. 

'''Required Android Permissions:''' 
* READ_CALENDAR used to export events from calendar
* WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE used to store the created ics-file so that it can be attached to email or send via bluetooth.

'''Sources:''' 
This is a fork of [[org.dgtale.icsimport]] that
* adds the export functionality and 
* supports Android versions prior to 4.0.

The following third party libraries are used:
* [[http://ical4j.sourceforge.net|ical4j]] A Java library for reading and writing iCalendar (*.ics) files. ical4j requires these libs/jars that are under terms of a separate license:
	* [[http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging/|commons-logging]] Commons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems, 
	* [[http://commons.apache.org/lang/|commons-lang]] classes that are in java.lang's hierarchy, or are considered to be so standard , 
	* [[http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-codec/|commons-codec]] simple encoder and decoders for various formats such as Base64 and Hexadecimal., 
	* [[http://backport-jsr166.sourceforge.net/|backport-util-concurrent]] Dawid Kurzyniec's backport of JSR 166.
