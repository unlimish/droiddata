Name:Calendar ICS adapter
Auto Name:android.calendar.ics.adapter
Summary:Import and export calendar files
Description:
Use a filemanager (i.e. [[org.openintents.filemanager]]), emailclient (i.e. [[com.fsck.k9]]) or bluetooth to import or export
android calendar entries via *.ics or *.ical files or attachments of type text/calendar.

The android.calendar.ics.adapter has no gui of its own. 
If you open an event from
the android calendar you can choose between "view event" and "send event to ...".
If you open an event from file/attachment you get a prepopulated "add to calender-form". 

android.calendar.ics.adapter is a fork of [[org.dgtale.icsimport]] that uses the [http://ical4j.sourceforge.net ical4j] library.

'''Required Android Permissions:''' 
* READ_CALENDAR used to export events from calendar
* WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE used to store the created ics-file so that it can be attached to email or send via bluetooth.
