Auto Name:android.calendar.ics.adapter
Summary:Import and export .ics calendar files
Description:
Helper that opens *.ics files of type text/calendar and displays the "Add to
calendar" dialog pre-populated. 

It also supports exporting calendars, either
as a file or as an attachment. 

This is a fork of [[org.dgtale.icsimport]] that
adds the export functionality and tries to support Android versions prior to
4.0.

'''Required Android Permissions:''' 
* READ_CALENDAR used to export events from calendar
* WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE used to store the created ics-file so that it can be attached to email or send via bluetooth.

'''Status:''' Works with android 4.0 and up. Should work with android 2.1 and up
but it is not garanteed, since there was no standard calender api before android 4.0
.
