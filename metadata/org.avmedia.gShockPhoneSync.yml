AutoName: GShockPhoneSync 
Description: |-
This app integrates the Casio G-shock B5600 series bluetooth watches, with Google services such as Google Calendar events 
and Google Alarm Clock. It is not meant to replace the official Casio app. Instead it converts your traditional G-shock 
into a semi-smart watch.

It also turns your Casio watch into a remote controller for your phone.
