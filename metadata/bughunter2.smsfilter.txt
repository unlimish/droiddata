Auto Name:SMS Filter
Summary:Filter text messages by keyword or address
Description:
SMS Filter can filter incoming SMS messages before they reach your inbox. You
can filter by address, and optionally add parts that must occur in the message
for it to be blocked.

By default, SMS Filter will not delete incoming messages. You will get a silent
status bar notification when SMS Filter has filtered an incoming message, which
you can view by opening the notification or by opening the application.

You can also tell SMS Filter to delete incoming messages, in which case it will
happily do so for you. To do this, just turn off the 'Save messages' preference.
