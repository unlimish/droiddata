Auto Name:Kwik EFIS
Summary:Electronic Flight Information System (EFIS)
Description:
Kwik EFIS is a Glass Cockpit application designed to work on most  Android
devices equipped with a GPS, gyroscope, accelerometer and a  CPU with reasonable
performance.

* Flight Director

Kwik EFIS has a fully functional flight director built in. It uses  the standard
V-Bar symbology common to modern flight directors.  The target waypoint and
altitude is set on-screen by means of the  spinner controls on the right top and
bottom of the screen.

* Demo Mode

There is also a "Demo Mode" available in the application. It is fairly
rudimentary and works like a crude flight simulator.  The heading and  altitude
can be changed by pitching and banking the device. The speed  runs up and down
automatically based on the pitch.
