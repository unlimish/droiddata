Summary: Luftlinie - Navigation for Birds
Description: |-
    This app works like this: You input where you want to go, then an arrow points you into that direction, oblivious of any barriers or other obstacles. That's it!

    How well this app works for you very much depends on the compass sensor and the GPS reception on your phone.
