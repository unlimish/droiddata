F-Droid is an installable catalogue of FOSS (Free and Open Source
Software) applications for the Android platform. The client makes it
easy to browse, install, and keep track of updates on your device.

It connects to any F-Droid compatible repositories. The default repo
is hosted at f-droid.org, which contains only bona fide Free and Open
Source Software.

Android itself is open in the sense that you are free to install apks
from anywhere you wish, but there are many good reasons for using
F-Droid as your free software app manager:

* Be notified when updates are available
* optionally download and install updates automatically
* Keep track of older and beta versions
* Filter apps that aren't compatible with the device
* Find apps via categories and searchable descriptions
* Access associated urls for donations, source code etc.
* Stay safe by checking repo index signatures and apk hashes
