Auto Name:Intent Radio
Summary:An intent-driven, GUI-less internet radio player
Description:
You might be interested in Intent Radio if:

* you use Android,
* you use Tasker, and
* you listen to internet radio.

''Intent Radio'' is an android internet radio app without a graphical user
interface.  It is controlled exclusively through the delivery of broadcast
intents.  If you do not know what a broadcast intent is, then this is
probably not the app for you.

''Intent Radio'' was written primarily to be driven by shortcuts, tasks and
events triggered from [http://tasker.dinglisch.net/ Tasker].

'''Important:''' You must run the app manually at least once before Android
will deliver broadcast intents.  This is an Android security feature.
