Auto Name:IntentRadio
Summary:Intent-driven internet radio player
Description:
Intent Radio is an android internet radio app without a graphical user
interface. It is controlled exclusively through the delivery of broadcast
intents. If you do not know what a broadcast intent is, then this is probably
not the app for you.

Intent Radio was written primarily to be driven by shortcuts, tasks and
events triggered from [http://tasker.dinglisch.net/ Tasker].

'''Important:''' You must run the app manually at least once before Android
will deliver broadcast intents. This is an Android security feature.
