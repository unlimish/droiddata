Auto Name:Track Work Time
Summary:Track your work time
Description:
It lets you categorize each recorded interval by a client/task and a free text.
The list of clients/tasks can be edited to suit your needs.

Additionally, if you wish, your flexible time account is taken care of:
you always see how much you worked.
You can also keep an eye on how much work time is left for today (by a
notification which you can enable).

You may provide the geo-coordinates of your work place and the app can
automatically clock you in while you are at work.
This is done without using GPS, so your battery wonâ€™t be emptied by this app.

Anti-feature: Tracking. Crash reports are sent without interaction.
