Auto Name:WiFi Tether
Summary:Wireless internet tethering
Description:
'''N.B''' The app isn't built entirely from source; there are bunch of prebuilt
programs like dnsmasq and iptables in the source code repository.

This is the latest version of <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/android.tether">WiFi Tether</a> but it's still a beta.

This program enables tethering (via WiFi and BT) for rooted handsets running
Android. Clients (your laptop for example) can connect (via ad-hoc mode) and get
access to the internet using the cellular data connection which is established
by the handset.

This application requires a rooted device (basic Android still doesn't allow
ad-hoc mode) and (probably) a custom-kernel which supports netfilter (iptables).
Please see the website for detailed information.
