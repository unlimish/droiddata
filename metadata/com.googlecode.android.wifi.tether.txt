Auto Name:WiFi Tether
Summary:Wireless internet tethering
Description:
'''N.B''' The app isn't built entirely from source; there are bunch of
prebuilt programs like dnsmasq and iptables in the source code repository.

This is the latest version of [[android.tether]] but it's still a beta.

This program enables tethering (via WiFi and BT) for rooted handsets running
Android. Clients (your
laptop for example) can connect (via ad-hoc mode) and get access to the
internet using the cellular
data connection which is established by the handset.

This application requires a rooted device (basic Android still doesn't allow
ad-hoc mode) and
(probably) a custom-kernel which supports netfilter (iptables). Please see the
website for detailed information.
