Auto Name:Open by Mapzen
Summary:Map search and navigation using OpenStreetMap
Description:
Open (by Mapzen) is a search and navigation app built with open source
software and open data.

Made with OSM, made for OSM. Users log into the app using an OpenStreetMap
account. They can optionally contribute GPS traces back to OpenStreetMap when
in navigation mode.

Really, really open. The app is built with the open source projects
OpenScienceMap, Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM), Pelias, and open source
SDKs built by Mapzen.

Itâ€™s a map, what do you think it does. Search. Maps. Routes for biking,
walking, and driving.

Open source, open data, open to improvements. We built Open as a proof of
concept to understand the current state of open data and open software for
mapping and navigation. The app and the data will only get better--but only
with your contributions.
