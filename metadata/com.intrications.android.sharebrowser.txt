Auto Name:Browser Intercept - Share URL
Summary:Peek at urls
Description:
When opening a web URL from an app Android never show you the address, only a
choice of browsers or opens the default browser.

This app allows you to share the URL, so you can see what domain it is. You can
install <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nightshadelabs.anotherbrowser">Flashify</a> to give an option to return to a
browser option.
