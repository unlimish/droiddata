Auto Name:AsciiCam
Summary:Replace pixels with text
Description:
AsciiCam generates images in real time from whatever your camera is
pointing at, either in greyscale, in the primary colors or in full color.
Instead of a normal image made of pixels, each area will have a coloured
letter of the latin alphabet or another ASCII character.

You can also create ASCII versions of pictures in your gallery, and optionally
have ASCII versions automatically generated every time you take a picture with
the standard camera app.
