Description:
Search [https://www.craigslist.org Craigslist] and save on bandwidth at the same
time. The search is only text, which presents you with a list of your search
criteria. Then, when you select a posting that you wish to see, it will be
displayed as normal in a special web view window. With simple colors and
controls, this helps you focus on what is really important: the posts!
