Auto Name:WaveUp
Summary:App that turns the display on when you wave over the proximity sensor
Description:
WaveUp is an Android app that wakes up your phone - switches the screen  on -
when you wave over the proximity sensor.

I have developed this app because I wanted to avoid pressing the power  button
just to take a look at the watch - which I happen to do a lot on  my phone.
There are already other apps that do exactly this - and even  more. I was
inspired by Gravity Screen On/Off, which is a great app.  However, I am a huge
fan of open source software and try to install  free software (free as in
freedom, not only free as in free beer) on my  phone if possible. I wasn't able
to find an open source app that did  this so I just did it myself.

Just wave your hand over the proximity sensor of your phone to turn  the screen
on. This is called wave mode and can be disabled in the  settings screen in
order to avoid accidental switching on of your  screen.

It will also turn on the screen when you take your smartphone out of  your
pocket or purse. This is called pocket mode and can also be  disabled in the
settings screen.

Both of these modes are enabled by default.

It also locks your phone and turns off the screen if you cover the  proximity
sensor for 1.5 seconds. This does not have a special name but  can nonetheless
be changed in the settings screen too. It is also  enabled by default.

For those who have never heard proximity sensor before: it is a small  thingie
that is somewhere near where you put your ear when you speak on  the phone. You
practically can't see it and it is responsible for  telling your phone to switch
off the screen when you're on a call.
