Auto Name:Gmote
Summary:Remote control
Description:
Gmote turns Android into a remote control for a computer, allowing users to run
movies and music at a distance.
It supports all of the standard remote control features such as play, pause,
rewind, volume controls etc.
It also has a built-in file browser that lets you select what to play.
Some typical use-cases
are people launching and controlling movies while sitting back on their couch,
or listening to music.

It also has a touch pad feature which allows you to control your mouse from
the phone, similar to a laptop
touchpad (also sending keystrokes typed in on the phone to the computer).
It's great for sitting back on
the couch while watching youtube or hulu.

Status: Version 2.0.7 elsewhere exists but there isn't any source
.
