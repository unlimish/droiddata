MaintainerNotes: |-
  The source code of the app contains several .jar files.
  However, they are not used in compilation of the app
  itself, but rather packaged as assets, so they can't
  be downloaded from maven by gradle automatically.

  We remove these jars and replace with our own, obtained
  from allowed sources: kotlin-stdlib.jar and
  kotlin-stdlib-common.jar are downloaded from MavenCentral,
  while android.jar and core-lambda-stubs.jar are copied
  from android sdk, installed on buildserver.

  Upstream splits apks based on architecture, however the size
  difference is negligible. 

  AntiFeatures:
  NonFreeNet: app allows to download additional libraries
  for projects from maven repos, however the list of these
  repos is fixed.

  Library versions:
  kotlin-stdlib.jar: 1.9.0
  kotlin-stdlib-common.jar: 1.9.0
  android.jar: 33.0.0
  core-lambda-stubs.jar: 33.0.0
