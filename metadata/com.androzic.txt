Summary:Navigation for ozf2/3 maps
Description:
Navigation client that uses OziExplorer (ozf2, ozfx3) or online maps.
Great for hiking, geocaching, off-roading, sailing, boating and other outdoor
activities. You are expected to be aware of OziExplorer or at least of where to
get its maps. Maps also can be created by yourself, but with some effort: see
FAQ and wiki on the website for details. Also hosted on
[https://bitbucket.org/andreynovikov bitbucket.org].

* works without maps as a simple navigator
* track recording in background (power-safe)
* navigation to waypoint and via route
* track to route conversion
* route creation and manipulation
* works with waypoints, tracks and routes in Ozi format
* reads waypoints, tracks and routes in KML and GPX format
* HSI and compass
* configurable units
* UTM coordinates
* search for locations via Google geocoder
* location and waypoint sharing
* portrait and landscape modes
* tablet support
Functionality can be extended by plugins (currently not on f-droid.org):
* receive coordinates via text messages (sms)
* share location in real time

Caution! Current version of Img2Ozf generates ozfx3 maps in new encrypted
format, they won't open in Androzic. Please use older versions of Img2Ozf,
last known good version is 3.03.
