Summary:Replace Amazfit Bip watchfaces in Mi Fit
Description:
This tool allows You to quickly replace custom watchface in Mi Fit. This way You
can use 11 custom watchfaces at one time, and there is no need to remember all
internal file names.

You can also replace watchfaces directly from [https://amazfitwatchfaces.com]

This tool only replaces watchfaces in Mi Fit. No direct gadget touching -
watchfaces are applied via an official application = more safe usage.
