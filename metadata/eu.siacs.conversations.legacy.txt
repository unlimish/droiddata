Auto Name:Conversations Legacy
Summary:Chat using the XMPP network
Description:
This special release of Conversations remains on the 1.23.x branch and will
provide the same user experience as it was prior to version 2.0.0

If you are new to this application you should check out the regular releases
called [[eu.siacs.conversations]]

Conversations Legacy is only suited for a small audience that can not live
without the features that have been removed in version 2.0.0 most notably:

* OTR
* Customizable Resources
* Swipe gesture to open the conversations overview.

Everyone else is strongly recommended to use Conversations instead.
