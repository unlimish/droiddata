Auto Name:Concentric Clock
Summary:Tell the time using concentric arcs
Description:
This is a clock that uses spinning and growing concentric arcs to tell
the time, and demonstrates in a dynamic way the factors of 60. The
minute hand is suggested by the start and end positions of the arcs,
while the hour of day is shown by the size of the outer arc.
