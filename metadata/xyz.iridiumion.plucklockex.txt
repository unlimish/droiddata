Auto Name:PluckLockEx
Summary:Lock your phone when snatched
Description:
Lock your phone when snatched. An updated and improved derivative of PluckLock.

This polls the accelerometer in the background and will lock the phone if the
sum of all non-gravitational forces ever exceeds the threshold.

<i>PluckLockEx</i> loads immediately into its preferences page, where you can set
the only preference relevant to the app's operation: the threshold at which the
phone will lock when it receives an acceleration jolt. The application will run
in the background, constantly monitoring the accelerometer to determine if the
phone has been taken from your hand. The app will start itself when you boot
your phone.
