AutoName: F-Droid Nearby
Description: |
  F-Droid Nearby is a simple app for exchanging free software apps locally,
  device-to-device, even when internet is not available or too expensive.  It is
  compatible with the built-in Nearby feature of the F-Droid client app.

  This is an early alpha version!  It might work really badly.
