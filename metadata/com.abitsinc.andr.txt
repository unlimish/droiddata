Auto Name:AB ITS Inc Flashlight Ad Free
Summary:Ad-free Flashlight App
Description:
This is a completely free flashlight application that uses the LED on your device's camera as a flashlight. If your device does not have a camera LED, it will paint a white box on your screen to enable it to serve as a poor substitute for a flashlight. The app requires the Camera permission to control your device's LED but you will notice that it does not require the Internet permission as it serves no ads.
