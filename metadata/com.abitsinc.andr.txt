Auto Name:Flashlight
Summary:Use your device's LED as flashlight
Description:
Uses the LED on your device's camera as a flashlight. If your device does not
have a camera LED, it will paint a white box on your screen to enable it to
serve as a poor substitute for a flashlight.

Requires the Camera permission to control your device's LED but you will notice
that it does not require the Internet permission as it serves no ads.
