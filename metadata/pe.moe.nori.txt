Auto Name:Nori
Summary:Online gallery viewer
Description:
Connect to Danbooru image galleries and browse by
tags (A swipe from the side reveals the action bar).

The safebooru.org site is preloaded which shows Anime images
that are considered 'safe for work'. Note that the images there are usually
of high quality and though the app is fast, a lot of data 
will be downloaded.
