  <b>NOTE:</b> App is no longer developed or maintained.

  Tigase Messenger is a mobile chat client to use with Jabber.org, Google Talk,
  Live Journal Talk, Nimbuzz, Ovi, and thousands of other services run by
  companies, ISPs, and volunteers around the world (a small list is on the page:
  <a href="https://xmpp.net/">https://xmpp.net/</a>).

  If you happen to have a few accounts on different servers, if you want to stay
  online when you are on the go, to be in contact with your friends and family all
  the time, if you love to share photos once you take them, then Tigase Messenger
  is for you.

  * Unlimited number of XMPP accounts
  * Address book integration
  * Photo sharing
  * Multi User Chat
  * Geolocation - share your location with friends
  * Save your battery

  All functions are available when you connect Tigase Messenger to our server
  (sure.im, jabber.me, tigase.im), on other servers, some functions may be
  unavailable.
