Auto Name:Weather Radar
Summary:An application featuring customizable, real-time doppler radar images
Description:
Weather Radar is an open-source application featuring doppler radar images from
the United States National Weather Service and Weather Underground's API.

The images are single images based on location rather than tiled images that can
be panned like most other applications of this type. This allows faster loading
when connection speeds are sub-optimal. Images can be customized including by
resolution to help keep data usage to a minimum when needed. You can save your
favorite views for easy reference.

National Weather Service radar imagery is available for the United States and
its territories. The Weather Underground radar imagery requires and API key from
their website to work. There is a test feature available so you can try it out
before acquiring your own API key. Their radar imagery is available for the
United States and some parts of Canada, Mexico, Western Europe, and Australia.
Their satellite imagery is available worldwide.

'''NOTE:''' Weather Underground discontinued free API keys at the same time I
released this application. If you already have an API key from them, it will
work. Otherwise, there doesn't seem to be a way to get the Weather Underground
images working. The NWS images still work fine.

I will work on integrating another source.
