Summary: Simulation of the Enigma Machine
Description: 
This is a simulation of the famous Enigma cipher machine used in the twentieth century and especially in the Second World War to encipher and decipher secret messages.
The Enigma Machine was a typewriter-like machine with 26 keys and corresponding lamps. It used a set of mechanical Rotors to achieve polyalphabetic substitution.
For even more scrambling there was a so called plugboard, where the sender of a message could connect pairs of letters to switch them over.

The Enigma Machine was broken during the second world war by the work of the allies (the three Polish cryptologists, Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Różycki and Henryk Zygalski created a Machine called "Bomba" which could break the enigma code.
After Germany invaded Poland, the work on breaking the enigma mainly took place in the UK. The british mathematician Alan Turing (known for his work on theoretical computer science) succeeded in completely breaking the Enigma.

Features:
	* Authentic Rotors
	* Ringsettings
	* Double Step Anomaly
	* Working plugboard

(I recommend the german article, since it is very detailed.)
