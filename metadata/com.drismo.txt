Auto Name:DriSMo
Summary:Driving feedback
Description:
Today’s technology already allow drivers to be guided by a GPS. To take this a
step further, this app provides a system to monitor and analyze the driving
quality by using the accelerometer (G-sensor) of your smartphone. This will help
you determine if the driving is good or bad, helping you improving your own
driving skills. Hence the name “Driving Skill Monitor” (DriSMo).

The goal of this application is to emphasize the attention towards good driving
quality and make the drivers aware of their own driving quality. By raising the
awareness of driving quality, you can increase the quality of driving. Fuel
efficiency will also be improved, as a result.
