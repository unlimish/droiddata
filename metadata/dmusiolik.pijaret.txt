Summary:Encrypt text by rotation
Description:
Pijaret is just another rotation encryption tool. The main purpose is to create
a small encryption tool to make services like Whatsapp or Telegram a bit more
secure. The system is easy to understand. You share a numeric key with your
partner in real life and en/de-crypt some important messages with it. (In case
you donâ€™t go outside you can just tormail your chat partner or stuff)
