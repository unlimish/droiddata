Summary:Open Observatory of Network Interference probe
Description:
Interested in collecting evidence of Internet censorship? Curious about the
speed and performance of the network that you are using?

By running the tests in this app, you will examine the following:

* Blocking of websites

* Presence of systems that could be responsible for censorship and/or surveillance

* Speed and performance of your network

These tests have been developed by the **Open Observatory of Network
Interference (OONI)**, a free software project (under The Tor Project) that aims
to uncover **Internet censorship** around the world. Since 2012, OONI has
collected millions of network measurements across more than 90
.
