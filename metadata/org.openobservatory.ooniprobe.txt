Auto Name:ooniprobe
Summary:Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)
Description:
Welcome to the global OONI community! With this app you can collect evidence of Internet censorship and measure the speed and performance of your network.

OONI Probe includes free software tests, designed and developed by the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI). We're a free software project under The Tor Project and we aim to increase transparency of Internet censorship around the world. 

Since 2012, the global OONI community has collected millions of network measurements from more than 200 countries, shedding light on multiple cases of Internet censorship worldwide.

By running OONI Probe, you can examine the blocking of websites, measure the speed and performance of your network, and search for middleboxes. We're integrating more OONI Probe tests into this app on an ongoing basis, so stay tuned!

**Collect evidence of Internet censorship**

OONI's Web Connectivity test is designed to measure whether sites are blocked by means of DNS tampering, TCP/IP blocking, or by a transparent HTTP proxy. By running this test, you will collect data that can serve as evidence of Internet censorship, and you will also receive relevant circumvention tips.

**Detect middleboxes**

OONI's HTTP Invalid Request Line and HTTP Header Field Manipulation tests are designed to uncover the presence of systems ("middleboxes") that could be responsible for censorship and surveillance.

**Measure the speed and performance of your network**

OONI's implementation of the Network Diagnostic Test (NDT) measures the speed and performance of your network, while the DASH test measures video streaming performance. Both tests can potentially be useful for examining cases of throttling and other net neutrality violations.

**Open data**

We publish all network measurement data that we collect because open data allows third parties to conduct independent studies, verify OONI findings and explore other research questions. Such data also helps increase transparency of Internet censorship around the world. All data is published on OONI Explorer (https://explorer.ooni.torproject.org/) and on our API (https://api.ooni.io/).

**Free software**

All of our tests are based on free and open source software. You can find the source code here: https://github.com/thetorproject/ooniprobe-android

**Disclaimer:** Running OONI Probe might be against the terms of service of your ISP or legally questionable in your country. By running OONI Probe, you will connect to web services which might be banned. The OONI project will publish data submitted by probes, possibly including your IP address or other identifying information. In addition, your use of OONI Probe will be clear to anyone who has access to your computer, and to anyone who can monitor your Internet connection (such as your employer, ISP or government).
