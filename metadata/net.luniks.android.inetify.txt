Auto Name:Inetify
Summary:WiFi Internet access helper
Description:
Inetify is an Android tool providing two features related to Wifi networks:
1.Give a notification if a Wifi network does not provide internet access.
2.Automatically activate Wifi when near a Wifi network and deactivate it
otherwise: this is
experimental and will use GPS when necessary, thus draining the battery

'''N.B''' It isn't possible to view your position on a map because Google Maps
is the only map source and f-droid can't supply an API key to use it. If you
need to use Google Maps install the developer's build from the website.
