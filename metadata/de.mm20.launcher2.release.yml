MaintainerNotes: |-
  Kvaesitso uses several external APIs for search providers.
  Several of them require signing up to obtain a developer API
  key: gdrive search, openweathermap, HERE and Meteorologisk
  institutt. It's not possible for users to provide these keys
  as explained here:
  https://github.com/MM2-0/Kvaesitso/issues/227#issuecomment-1366826219
  If keys are not provided, these features are automatically
  disabled during the build.

  core/shared/build.gradle.kts and plugins/sdk/build.gradle.kts
  have configurations in them for publishing artifacts to
  maven repos. They are not used during the build, but detected
  by F-Droid scanner anyway. We patch it out from
  core/shared/build.gradle.kts, since this module itself is
  still used in compilation, and delete plugins/sdk/build.gradle.kts
  because it's not used in app compilation.

  Kvaesitso depended on different libraries used for gdrive
  login in the past that pulled GMS dependency, however it's
  not the case anymore:
  https://github.com/MM2-0/Kvaesitso/issues/583#issuecomment-1775268896
  The new libraries pull OpenTelemetry though, but it's unclear
  if it's used (considering gdrive integration is disabled).

  Max heap size is reduced in gradle.properties to avoid gradle
  daemon being killed by OOM manager.

  Older versions of Kvaesitso had onedrive integration that
  depended on non-whitelisted maven repos, but it was removed.

  Upstream provides an fdroid flavor, however there's no difference
  with default flavor except for different versionName.

  For some reason, F-Droid fails to pick up the correct gradle
  version from distributionUrl if subdir is used.

  Older patches:
  * remove_ms-services.patch removes microsoft azure sdk maven
  repo and its usage (onedrive integration) across the project.

  * remove_gservices.patch removes gdrive integration, as one
  of dependencies it relies on contains known non-free classes,
  according to f-droid scanner.

  * remove_ms_g_2023012300.patch removes microsoft and google
  services from the source code, while patching of respective
  modules build.gradle.kts files is done with sed edits, since
  these files are changed often.
