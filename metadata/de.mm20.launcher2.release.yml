MaintainerNotes: |-
  Kvaesitso uses several external APIs for search providers.
  Several of them require signing up to obtain a developer API
  key: gdrive and onedrive search, openweathermap, HERE
  and Meteorologisk institutt. It's not possible for users
  to provide these keys as explained here:
  https://github.com/MM2-0/Kvaesitso/issues/227#issuecomment-1366826219
  Therefore, these features are disabled in F-Droid build.

  Kvaesitso uses a non-whitelisted microsoft maven repo for
  OneDrive integration. The libraries used are open source,
  but we still remove the respective code from the source,
  since onedrive integration is disabled anyway.

  Older patches:
  * remove_ms-services.patch removes microsoft azure sdk maven
  repo and its usage (onedrive integration) across the project.

  * remove_gservices.patch removes gdrive integration, as one
  of dependencies it relies on contains known non-free classes,
  according to f-droid scanner.

  Patches:
  * remove_ms_g_2023012300.patch removes microsoft and google
  services from the source code, while patching of respective
  modules build.gradle.kts files is done with sed edits, since
  these files are changed often.

  Upstream provides an fdroid flavor, however there's no difference
  and it still needs to be patched.

  For some reason, f-droid fails to pick up the correct gradle
  version (compilation fails with default gradle version)
  from distributionUrl if subdir is used.
