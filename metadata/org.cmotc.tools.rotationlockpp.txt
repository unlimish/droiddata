Name:Rotation Lock + Landscape
Auto Name:Rotation Lock+Landscape
Summary:Stop screen auto-rotation
Description:
Turn on/off Auto-rotate screen quickly by long pressing search button.

When you are lying on bed. The screen changes to landscape. Have to open system
settings to disable Auto-rotate screen. Did you find it is really inconvenient?
This app provides a super easy way for switching this setting. And it provides a
state icon to indicate the current setting.
