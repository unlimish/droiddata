Auto Name:Primary
Summary:A simple educational practice game for kids (and adults).
Description:
Primary is a slightly gamified educational application aimed at
Primary (Elementary) school-aged children, but of course adults who wish to
sharpen their skills will find it useful as well.  There are levels
dealing with basic math, sorting, clocks, spelling, plurals, etc., with new 
subjects planned for the future.

See the website for a full list of subjects and features.
