Description:
'''This app comes pre-installed on many custom roms. In that case, to upgrade,
you would have to
remove the original from /system/app because it is signed with a different key.
We include this in the repo as it is the latest version for which full source
code is available.'''

Any app that requires root access must call the su binary which in turn calls
this app to prompt the
user for permission.
This app is also used to manage which apps have root permission as well as
monitor their usage of the permission.

This app assumes you have the su binary installed i.e. have root.
