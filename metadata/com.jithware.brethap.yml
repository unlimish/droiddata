Summary: This application is for controlling your breathing while meditating
Description: Brethap is yet another meditation app (yama). Including a timer for meditation,
    it also allows you to configure a breathing pattern for you to follow. Your sessions
    will be saved, allowing you to monitor and view stats about your progress in either
    a list or calendar view. Duration, breath and other options are configurable through
    saved preferences.
