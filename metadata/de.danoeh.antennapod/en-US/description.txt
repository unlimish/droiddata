Podcast manager and player that gives you instant access to millions of free and
paid podcasts, from independent podcasters to large publishing houses such as
the BBC, NPR and CNN. Add, import and export their feeds hassle-free using the
iTunes podcast database, gPodder, OPML files or simple RSS URLs. Save effort,
battery power and mobile data usage with powerful automation controls for
downloading episodes (specify times, intervals and WiFi networks) and deleting
episodes (based your favourites and delay settings). But most importantly:
Download, stream or queue episodes and enjoy them the way you like with
adjustable playback speeds, chapter support and a sleep timer.

Made by podcast-enthousiasts, AntennaPod is kept free of ads and frequently
updated based on your input.

'''N.B.''' The Flattr functionality is disabled in this build as the API keys
