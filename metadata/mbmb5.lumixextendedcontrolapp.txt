Auto Name:Eylca
Summary:Control a lumix camera remotely
Description:
Aims at extending lumix camera abilities. Eylca currently allows to shoot
pictures or to record a video when a motion is detected in what the camera sees.
This application is unofficial. It is not an official Panasonic product, and it
is not approved by or associated with Panasonic in any way. For basic camera
control over wifi, please use the official app instead.  Please note that it is
only tested on the FZ1000, but it should work on most Lumix cameras.
