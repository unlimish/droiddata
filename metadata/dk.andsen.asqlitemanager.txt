Auto Name:aSQLiteManager
Summary:SQLite (small database) frontend
Description:
Front end allowing management of SQLite databases. These are very commonly used
by apps to store settings
in the /data directory, but you would need root access to move them to a
location that this app can edit
them from. If you try to enter that directory with this app's file manager it
suggests you install aShell to do it directly, but we don't have that in the
repo as the source code is not yet available.
