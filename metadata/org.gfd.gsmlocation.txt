Auto Name:GSMLocationBackend
Summary:UnifiedNlp location provider (OpenCellID)
Description:
[[com.google.android.gms]] backend that uses [http://opencellid.org OpenCellID].

Location calculation is done onboard and works without network connectivity. The
cell-tower based lookup for your current location is implemented via a included
binary cell database extracted from [http://opencellid.org OpenCellID].

This "NetworkLocationProvider" works without network connectivity and will never
post your data anywhere. You are thus encouraged to help OpenCellID to gather
more cells in order to improve this project.

[[de.enaikoon.android.keypadmapper3]] can be used to gather cell information for
OpenCellID.
