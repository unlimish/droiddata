Description: |-
  SQLiteViewer allows to view and export as csv SQLite databases used by android
  apps or any SQLite databases with ease and simplicity.

  <b>Features:</b>

  * Open any SQLite database using the built in file browser
  * Open database of any app from the root filesystem (Requires root)
  * Export SQLite database to csv (Beware of the huge row count)
  * Supports custom query! Run any sqlite query on the selected databases. Subqueries, limit, order by, you name it, the app supports it.

  <b>Permissions Explained:</b>

  * READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - For opening databases from storage or writing exported csv file

  AntiFeatures: Tracking - Even if analytics/crash submission is toggled off, the
  app still submits data to the developers servers.
