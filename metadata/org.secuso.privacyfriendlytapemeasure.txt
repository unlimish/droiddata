Auto Name:Tape Measure
Summary:Turn your device into a tape measure or ruler
Description:
Privacy Friendly Tape Measure can measure the size of objects in pictures based
on objects of known sizes (e.g. coins) in the same picture. Just find a coin or
other reference object of a known size, put it next to the item you want
measured and take a picture. Make sure all objects are in the same level and the
picture is taken perpendicularly to it. Now you can mark the reference object in
the picture and measure any length or area you want!

Privacy Friendly Tape Measure belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group
developed by the research group SECUSO at Technische UniversitÃ¤t Darmstadt.

Privacy Friendly Tape Measure can also display rulers or a protractor on the
screen. Use this to quickly measure small objects or to cut a pizza in six equal
slices.
