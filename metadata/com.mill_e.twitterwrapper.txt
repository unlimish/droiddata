Auto Name:Tinfoil for Twitter
Summary:Twitter browser with privacy
Description:
Browse Twitter's mobile site with a simple web browser, which protects your
privacy by avoiding the ability of the page and others to track your browsing
history. It also includes other functionalities, like shortcuts to the
notifications page or app settings to control whether your current location is
to be provided to Twitter's website.

The COARSE_LOCATION permission is only used if you enable "Allow Check-ins" on
the preferences section, which is disabled by default.

AntiFeatures:
* Tracking. You are required to log in to Twitter.
