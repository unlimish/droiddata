Auto Name:Debian Kit
Summary:Install Debian alongisde your system
Description:
It's possible to install a complete GNU/Linux software stack on Android devices,
e.g. by adding a chroot environment as others already have implemented. This kit
does 2 things differently: firstly, it installs a Debian file system
side-by-side to the Android file system. In order to access anything thatâ€™s
accessible from Android also from the Debian side. And secondly, the Debian
bootstrap is executed on the Device itself without any help of a larger PC,
Android debugging bridge or similar.
