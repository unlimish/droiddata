Summary:A kit to install Debian on Android devices
Description:
It's possible to install a complete Linux software stack on Android
devices, e.g. by adding a chroot environment as others already have
implemented.
This kit does 2 things differently: firstly, it installs a Debian file
system side-by-side to the Android file system. In order to access
anything thatâ€™s accessible from Android also from the Debian side. And
secondly, the Debian bootstrap is executed on the Device itself
without any help of a larger PC, Android debugging bridge or similar.
