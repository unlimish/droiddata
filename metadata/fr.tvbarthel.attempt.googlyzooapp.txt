Summary:Head-tracking virtual pet
Description:
Choose your favorite virtual Googly pet and simply move your face in front of
your smartphone to wake it up. Once your virtual pet is awake, its Googly Eyes
will track you for hours without blinking! Even if your new virtual pet doesn't
show any signs of tiredness, it will automatically fall asleep as soon as you
disappear from your screen.

AntiFeature: Billing library required.
