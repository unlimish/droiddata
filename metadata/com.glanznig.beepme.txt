Summary:Experience sampling (ESM/DES)
Description:
BeepMe is an app for the conduction of experience sampling (ESM/DES).
Once activated the app sends out beeps at random times. You can enter notes,
tags and a photo regarding your inner experience at the moment of the beep.

This data can then either be used in interviews (DES) or being collected directly (ESM).
