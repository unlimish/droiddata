AutoName: Quicksy
Summary: Jabber/XMPP with Easy Entry and Easy Discovery
Description: |-
    Quicksy is a spin off of the popular Jabber/XMPP client
    [[eu.siacs.conversations]] with automatic contact discovery.

    You sign up with your phone number and Quicksy will automatically—based on
    the phone numbers in your address book—suggest possible contacts to you.

    Under the hood Quicksy is a full-fledged Jabber client that lets you
    communicate with any user on any publicly federating server. Likewise users
    on Quicksy can be contacted from the outside simply by adding
    +phonenumber@quicksy.im to your contact list.

    Aside from the contact sync the user interface is deliberately as close to
    Conversations as possible. This allows users to eventually migrate from
    Quicksy to Conversations without having to relearn how the app works.

    Suggested contacts consists of other Quicksy users and regular Jabber/XMPP
    users who have entered their Jabber ID into the
    [https://quicksy.im/#get-listed Quicksy Directory].

    NOTE: To [https://quicksy.im/enter/ enter] your Jabber ID in the Quicksy
    directory an one time registration fee is required.
