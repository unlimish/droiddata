Auto Name:RTL2832U driver
Summary:Port of rtl-sdr's rtl_tcp
Description:
Allows you to use I/Q packet source in your Android applications.

All you need is to launch an intent in the form "iqsrc://rtl_tcp_arguments"
where you replace rtl_tcp_arguments with the arguments that you want your
application to run rtl_tcp with and the magic will be done behind the scenes.

This driver could be used by third party applications to implement Software
Defined Radio.

It does not require root for Android 3.1 and above.
