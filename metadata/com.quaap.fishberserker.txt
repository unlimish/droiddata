Auto Name:Seafood Berserker!
Summary:Seafood Berserker
Description:
No ninjas, no fruit. Just heavy-metal Vikings who love to slice seafood!

Slice all the seafood from entering your Viking ship, but don't chop the
anchors! It has two modes, "Classic" where you lose a life for each  missed
food, and "arcade" where you just go for points.

I started this game a long time ago as a joke, but illness and family  matters
eventually made it so I couldn't finish it. So I just cleaned  it up a bit and
published it now because I'm not sure when I'll get  back to it! I hope someone
can enjoy it!
