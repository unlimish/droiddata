Summary:Secure messaging
Description:
This Instant Messenger has a built-in end-to-end point encryption,
which means every outgoing message is only readable by your
contact.

On the installation the application creates a key pair on your phone
device.
One Public-Key and a Private-Key, with the Public-Key you can encrypt messages
but you cannot decrypt it.
Decryption is only possible with your Private-Key.

The messages go via a server and you enter a phone number into the
app so that your friends know how to find you.
