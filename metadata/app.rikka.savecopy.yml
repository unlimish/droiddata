Summary:
  Simple Android app, handles ACTION_VIEW, saves a copy of the file. For bad
  apps which only allow users to open files.

Description:
  <p>One of the biggest changes of Android 11 is that all apps targeting 30 can
  only access its' private folder. Google Play will force new/updated apps to
  upgrade their target API one year later, so apps must make changes.</p>
  <p>However, the problem is, some app does not do this correctly. For example,
  some chat apps, save <strong>files users received from other users</strong> to
  their <strong>private folder</strong> (<code>Android/data</code>) and does not
  provide options to copy/move these files. In Android 11, no one except the app
  itself can access those files, so users have to open those apps every time.
  This is very inconvenient and unreasonable. At least those apps allow the user
  to open files with other apps. So we have a chance.</p> <p>This app does a
  very simple thing, handle <code>ACTION_VIEW</code>, and save the file to the
  <code>Download</code> folder.</p>
