Player Classic). VLC also now requires a password to be set. For your "IP
Address", run "Command Prompt" on the PC where VLC or Media Player Classic is
playing, and type ipconfig. It should be listed under "IPv4 Address". If you are
having trouble setting up, please check out the webpage/Online Help for advice.
