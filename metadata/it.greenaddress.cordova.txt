Auto Name:GreenAddress.It
Summary:GreenAddress client
Description:
Wallet that uses multisig to improve security (adding 2 factor for instance or limits)
and Hierarchical Deterministic addresses (see
[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032 BIP32]).

It offers the advantages of a web wallet:
* Ubiquitously available
* Social/email/sms integration
* Two factor authentication
* Transactions limits/restrictions
* Greenaddress instant transaction

and the advantages of a local software wallet like Electrum:
* Mnemonic seed backup once and forget
* Your private keys are never on the server, not even encrypted
* No long wait to synchronize the full client with the Bitcoin blockchain

See [https://greenaddress.it their website] and [https://greenaddress.it/faq their FAQ]
for more information.

Supports NFC for login and QR code scanning for login and transactions.

Maintainer Notes:
scandelete libscrypt.so - it is built by F-Droid via prepare_fdroid.sh,
but it is still in GreenAddress repo for users who don't want to use NDK,
so it needs to be removed before building to pass scanning.
