Auto Name:Truly Random
Summary:Generate random gradients
Description:
Use a random number generator at Australia National University's Quantum Numbers
lab to generate random gradients.

If you are not connected to the internet, the generated numbers and gradients
will still be random, but not as random as the numbers you could get by being
connected to the internet.
