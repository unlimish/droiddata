Summary:Read and write encrypted e-mails
Description:
p≡p is a cyber security solution which protects the confidentiality and
reliability of communications for citizens, for public offices and for
enterprises. It provides end-to-end cryptography in all common crypto-standards
through the app that you install on your phone.

p≡p for Android makes e-mail encryption easy on mobile devices for everyone by
automatic and seamless integration of end-to-end encryption. Set it up with your
existing e-mail address under a minute. Send and receive as many messages as you
want without any restrictions on the number of devices the p≡p app runs on.

p≡p supports the user with advanced automation and is fully compatible with
OpenPGP

* it will automatically encrypt your e-mail and attachments, including pictures
* it can ensure no one can intercept your perfectly encrypted e-mail
* it is peer-to-peer and uses no central service
* it works with all your existing e-mail account(s)
* it can authenticate your communication partner and prevent identity theft

p≡p is end-to-end and supports all commonly used Android devices.

p≡p is easy for your recipients too – depending on their security capabilities,
they can exchange encrypted messages with you.

With p≡p, you don’t need a separate account, you can send secure messages to
anyone anywhere, regardless of their email provider.

Just install the app and you can communicate in confidence with your peers.
