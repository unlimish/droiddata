Auto Name:DSC Auto Rename
Summary:Rename picutres based on date
Description:
Automatically change the name of images files taken by the camera based on the
date and time when the file was created.

'''Renamed and moved files process cannot be rolled back! Use this software with
caution!'''

The application does not store the old names because will cause conflicts: the
default camera application use a counter which is reset each time when files are
removed/renamed. As a workaround can be selected the option "Append original
name".
