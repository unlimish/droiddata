Summary:Answer calls when you're busy
Description:
QuiteSleep is an application for Android 2.0+ which manages your
incoming calls when you're busy, sleeping, or doing anything between
two time slots in any day of the week. QuiteSleep can block a list
of callers or even other different incoming calls and send an SMS
or e-mail with a predefined text to notify you're busy, sleeping, etc.

Four different ways to allow who can call you:

1) block all; 2) block only blocked contacts; 3) block unknown 4) block unknown and blocked contacts
