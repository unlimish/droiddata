Auto Name:EVE Mining Calc
Summary:Mining Helper for EVE Online
Description:
This simple app let's you select some ores and will fetch their prices in
Tradehubs. Then it will display them sorted by your profit so you don't have to
worry about things like checking their prices, volumes and calculating your
profit. You can also specify systems: Telling the app that you are in a 0.7
Gallente system will make it display only the ores that are avaible there.
