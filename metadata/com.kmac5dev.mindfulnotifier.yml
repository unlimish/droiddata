AutoName: Mindful Notifier
Summary: A mindfulness bell with configurable text notifications, schedules, and sound
Description: |
    This app is a simple mindfulness-based timer which displays a
    notification/reminder at user-defined intervals. It is another
    take on a '''Mindfulness Bell''', with the addition of accompanying text.
    The reminders are taken from a configurable list, and are chosen
    at random at a selected interval. The reminder interval can either
    be periodic (in intervals down to a 15 minute granularity) or random
    (between a selected range of minutes).

    Some default reminders are provided as examples. You can add,
    edit, or remove these default reminders as you like.

    There are 5 bells included, and you can also configure a custom bell
    from your phone's local storage.

    This app works very well in conjunction with a smartwatch. In
    this mode you can also mute the bell to have silent mindfulness
    prompts throughout your day.
