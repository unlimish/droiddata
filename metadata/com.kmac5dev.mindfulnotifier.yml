AutoName: Mindful Notifier
Summary: A mindfulness bell with configurable text notifications, schedules, and sound
Description: |
    Mindful Notifier is a simple mindfulness-based app which displays a
    notification reminder at user-configurable intervals. It is another
    take on a 'Mindfulness Bell', with the addition of accompanying text
    to provide added context to the mindfulness reminder.

    The reminders are taken from a configurable list, and are chosen
    at random at each interval. The reminder interval can either
    be periodic (in intervals aligned to the top of the hour, down
    to a 15 minute granularity) or random (between a selected range
    of minutes).

    Some default reminders are provided as examples. You can add,
    edit, or remove these default reminders as you like.

    There are 5 different bells included, and you can also configure
    your own custom bell from your phone's local storage.

    This app works very well in conjunction with a smartwatch. In
    this mode you can also mute the bell to have silent mindfulness
    prompts throughout your day.
