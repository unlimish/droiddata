Auto Name:Network
Summary:Shortcut to the Phone Info page
Description:
Simply a shortcut to the activity that you get when you type *#*#INFO#*#* in the
dialer. It allows you to choose different radio modes and see general info. In
particular you can choose WCDMA only, which could improve battery life if your
phone is in a weak 3G area and tries to find a 2G signal all the time. The PRL
choices only apply to operators that keep a PRL list.
