Auto Name:Network
Summary:Shortcut to the Phone Info page
Description:
Simply a shortcut to the activity that you get when you type *#*#INFO#*#* in the dialer. It allows you to
choose different radio modes and see general info. In particular you can choose WCDMA only, which
could improve battery life if your phone is in a weak 3G area and tries to
find a 2G signal all the time. The PRL choices only apply to operators that keep a PRL list.
