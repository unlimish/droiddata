AutoName: BotBrew Basil
Description: |-
  Botbrew Basil is a frontend application which allows to install
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian">Debian</a> in a
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot">chroot</a> on your Android device, and manage
  installed packages and running services via comfortable UI.

  Botbrew release "Basil" uses dpkg, unlike previous release Botbrew "Anise" (not
  available as open-source) which used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opkg">opkg</a>.
  It uses official Debian and Emdebian package repositories, though some bootstrap
  and support packages are downloaded from botbrew.com.

  Before deleting the Botbrew bootstrap directory, open the control/preferences
  window and tap 'exit' to make sure everything has been unmounted properly.
