Auto Name:Rehearsal Assistant
Summary:A voice/sound recording tool
Description:
A voice / sound recording utility with two modes of operation:

Session Mode: organizes recordings into sessions, and time-stamps relative to
the beginning of the
session, making it useful for recording your thoughts and observations during
an event. If you are a
choreographer or director watching a rehearsal of your work, this can help
you make note of the feedback you want to share with the cast.

Simple Mode: easy recording and playback of sound files.
If you are a musician or writer, it can help
you record and remember your spontaneous moments of inspiration.
Also works great for shopping lists and
other kinds of reminders.
