Summary:CyanogenMod file manager backport
Description:
A backport of the CyanogenMod File Manager application to ICS and higher.  
This is an unofficial fork of the main CyanogenMod File Manager project.

changed by choosing a different security access mode in the General preferences. 
Then root will be called for if you try to change something that normally can't be.
