AutoName: snowhow
Description: |-
    The SNOWHOW-Freeride App offers offline use of maps from the Alps. With an
    adjustable layer you can check the incline (steepness) of the slopes.  The
    slope incline is a key parameter for European decision making strategies in
    wintery and avalanche prone terrain.

    The SNOWHOW-Freeride App is no substitute for any other tools of
    orientation and decision making and necessary safety gear.  Shown tracks
    and map information are not recommendations for any terrain use.

    '''Features:'''

    * Color coding for incline
    * Weather data and Avalanche Bulletin
    * Download maps for the Alps region
