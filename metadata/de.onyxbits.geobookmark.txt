Auto Name:Geo Bookmark
Summary:Save timestamped geo-bookmarks
Description:
A simple widget that will add a bookmark with your current time and
geographical location to the homescreen. The interface is kept minimal
to allow operation in situations that do not permit extensive interaction
with the phone (e.g. while driving a car).

Bookmarks are color coded. Blue icons represent exact locations, red icons
mean that the widget could not get a GPS fix within 40 seconds and therefore
recorded the last known GPS location.

In order to view a bookmark, a suitable maps application needs to be installed
(e.g. [[net.osmand.plus]]).
