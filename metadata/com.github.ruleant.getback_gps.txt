Auto Name:GetBack GPS
Summary:Navigation tool
Description:
Find your way back to a previously visited location using GPS coordinates.

Imagine visiting a town, going to an event or doing some hiking.
When finished, you have to find your car again, or the way to the station, or any other point where you started.
Store a location when you start your trip, and at the end of the day, find your way back to where you started.

Features:
* determine location based on GPS signal, WiFi or cell phone network:
  * use best/most accurate location provider
  * get location updates automatically (based on a time interval or change of location) or
  * get location on demand (by manually refreshing)
* save a location
* ‘get back’ mode: indicator pointing to a stored location (showing distance and direction)
* indicate current speed and current bearing
.
