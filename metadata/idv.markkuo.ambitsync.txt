Auto Name:AmbitSync
Summary:Read Suunto Ambit watches and convert to GPX
Description:
''AmbitSync'' is an app to download sport logs (or "moves") from Suunto Ambit
GPS watch and convert them to GPX file right on your Android device through the
Ambit charging USB cable. No interaction with Movescount website is needed. It
also supports Strava upload.

You will only need the Ambit USB cable and an OTG cable (Type-C or Micro-B to
Type-A receptacle cable), connect your watch with the Ambit USB cable through
the OTG cable to your Android device's USB port. Your device should support USB
host mode or this won't work at all.

Note that this app requires network permission just for Strava upload. You may
choose not to upload to Strava. The app does not communicate with Movescount at
all.

'''Disclaimer:''' Although this app does "read-only" access from your Ambit
watch, it does not guarantee 100% safe and functional. Also it is not proven to
work on any Android devices + Ambit watch combinations.
