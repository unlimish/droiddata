Summary:Screen off remote control
Description:
A remote control that saves battery and runs for example on the Galaxy S3 for about 10 hours, because it still works while the screen is off. Using the volume up and down buttons there is no need to have the screen on all the time, so the user can switch the screen off and still continue to use this buttons. The phone doesn't enter deep sleep, so it still uses more energy, but because the screen is the biggest consumer it saves a lot! This app works like most remote controls, just download the server on the computer and enter the ip address into the app. However, the server is a Java jar-file and so no installation is needed and usage is very simple. This app is still a prototype! Any helpful critics is welcome.


Anti-Feature: Uses a link with advertisement  to the download of the server part. However, there is an optional direct link without advertisement.
