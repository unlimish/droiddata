Auto Name:aLogcat ROOT
Summary:System and app log viewer
Description:
An app equivalent of logcat from the terminal. You can filter by importance in
the settings: see only errors or view general debugging info. The result can
then be filtered by keyword so if an app has problems you can send just the
relevant logs to the developer. But watch out, the filter remains in place
unless you remove it!

This application is fork of [[org.jtb.alogcat]] and it works only on devices
running Android 4.1+. If you have root access full system logs are shown,
otherwise only this applications logs are shown.
