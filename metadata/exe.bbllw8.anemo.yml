AutoName: Anemo
Description: |-
  Anemo is an utility application made of two components: a private local storage, and a text editor.

  Instead of being a stand-alone file manager user interface, it hooks into various components of
  Android making it feel like a native part of the operative system.
  The text editor can read and edit and create text files from the device or other apps.
