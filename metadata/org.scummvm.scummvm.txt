Unlike upstream build, this one has all plugins bundled together in single apk.
External plugin apks (e.g. from Google Play) won't work with this version and
must be removed before installing it.

Maintainer Notes:
Releases are tagged, but according to backends/platform/android/android.mk (which also contains
version codes -- however, it hasn't been raised in a while), Market uploads take priority. They
may lag notably behind general development, so checking http://sourceforge.net/projects/scummvm/files/scummvm/
is advisable as well.
