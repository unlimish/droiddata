Auto Name:Vector
Summary:Open team chat
Description:
Vector gathers all your conversations and app integrations into one single app.

Built around group chatrooms, Vector lets you share messages, images, videos and
files - interact with your tools and access all your different communities under
one roof. One single identity and place for all your teams: no need to switch
accounts, work and chat with people from different organisations in public or
private rooms: from professional projects to school trips, Vector will become
the center of all your discussions!

Features include:

* Instantly share messages, images, videos and files of any kind within groups of any size
* See who's reading your messages with read receipts
* Communicate with users anywhere in the Matrix.org ecosystem - not just Vector users!
* Discover and invite users by email address
* Participate in guest-accessible public rooms
* Highly scalable - supports hundreds of rooms and thousands of users
* Fully synchronised message history across multiple devices and browsers
* Finely configurable notification settings, synchronised over all devices
* Infinite searchable chat history
* Permalinks to messages
* Full message search
* Excellent support for all Android device sizes and orientations

Note that the F-Droid release does not use GCM for notifications - instead it
will keep syncing in the background. If you find that the ongoing background
sync is using too much battery, you can add a delay or change the timeout of the
sync or even disable background sync completely, in the settings page.

For developers:

* Vector is a Matrix client - built on the Matrix.org open standard and ecosystem, providing interoperability with all other Matrix compatible apps, servers and integrations
* Entirely open sourced under the permissive Apache License - get the code from [https://github.com/vector-im/vector-android]. Pull requests welcome!
* Trivially extensible via the open Matrix Client-Server API ([https://matrix.org/docs/spec])
* Run your own server! You can use the default matrix.org server or run your own Matrix home server (e.g. [https://matrix.org/docs/projects/server/synapse.html])

Coming soon:

* Add your own integrations, bridges and bots!
* Email notifications of missed messages and invites
* End-to-end encryption using Olm ([https://matrix.org/git/olm])
* Voice and video calling and conferencing (already available on the web version at [https://vector.im])
* Screen sharing
* Login as multiple users at the same time

Discover truly efficient and open collaboration with Vector!
