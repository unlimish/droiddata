Auto Name:Vector: open team chat
Summary:Vector gathers all your conversations and app integrations into one single app
Description:
Built around group chatrooms, Vector lets you share messages, images, videos and
files - interact with your tools and access all your different communities under
one roof. One single identity and place for all your teams: no need to switch
accounts, work and chat with people from different organisations in public or
private rooms: from professional projects to school trips, Vector will become
the center of all your discussions!

Features include:

* Instantly share messages, images, videos and files of any kind within groups of any size
* See who's reading your messages with read receipts
* Communicate with users anywhere in the Matrix.org ecosystem - not just Vector users!
* Discover and invite users by email address
* Participate in guest-accessible public rooms

* Fully synchronised message history across multiple devices and browsers
* Finely configurable notification settings, synchronised over all devices
* Infinite searchable chat history

For developers:

* Vector is a Matrix client - built on the Matrix.org open standard and ecosystem, providing interoperability with all other Matrix compatible apps, servers and integrations
* Entirely open sourced under the permissive Apache License - get the code from [https://github.com/vector-im/vector-android]. Pull requests welcome!
* Trivially extensible via the open Matrix Client-Server API ([https://matrix.org/docs/spec])
* Run your own server! You can use the default matrix.org server or run your own Matrix home server (e.g. [https://matrix.org/docs/projects/server/synapse.html])

Coming soon:
