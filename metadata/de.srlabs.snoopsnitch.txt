Auto Name:SnoopSnitch
Summary:Check mobile network security
Description:
Collects and analyzes mobile radio data to make you aware of your mobile
network security and to warn you about threats like fake base stations
(IMSI catchers), user tracking and over-the-air updates. With SnoopSnitch
you can use the data collected in the GSM Security Map at [http://gsmmap.org]
and contribute your own data to GSM Map.

Requirements:
* Qualcomm-based Android phone (see list below)
* Stock Android ROM, version 4.1 or later
* Note: Unfortunately, custom Android ROMs like CyanogenMod are not supported, as they lack the drivers necessary to collect radio data.
* Root privileges on phone

The following devices have been verified to work:
* Samsung S3 Neo (GT-I9301I)
* LG G2 (LG-D802)
* Sony Xperia Z1 (C6903)
* Samsung S5 (SM-G900F)
* Motorola Moto E (Moto E)
* Samsung S4 (Qualcomm variant)

It is very likely that other Qualcomm-based Android phones also work, if they are rooted and have a stock firmware.

Incompatible Devices:
* Samsung Galaxy S2 & S3
* Nexus 5
* Huawei Ascend Y300
