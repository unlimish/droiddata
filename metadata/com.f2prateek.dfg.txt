Auto Name:Device Frame Generator
Summary:Realistic borders for screenshots
Description:
The device frame generator allows you to quickly wrap your app screenshots in
real device artwork, providing better context for your screenshots. You can
generate screenshots through sharing in Android, as well as perform batch
operations.

This app will no longer be updated; Upstream started using proprietary libraries
heavily.
