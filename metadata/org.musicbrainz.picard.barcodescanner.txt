Auto Name:Picard Barcode Scanner
Summary:MusicBrainz Picard scanner
Description:
Load releases into MusicBrainz Picard by using your phone as a barcode scanner.
When scanning the barcode of an album, the app will search MusicBrainz for
matching releases and load them into Picard on your desktop computer.

This is especially useful if you have your physical music collection already
digitalized and want to tag the files using exactly the album you own.

Please note: This is not a music file tagger for Android but rather a helper
tool for MusicBrainz Picard on your desktop. Requirements:

* Picard 1.0 or later
* Your phone and the computer running Picard should be both on the same network, and the port 8000 should be accessible

It is also worth noting that, in order for this app to work, you need to install
[[com.google.zxing.client.android]], which is not shown by default as it
promotes Non-Free Add-ons.
