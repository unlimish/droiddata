Auto Name:SAnd
Summary:Show orientation, height and airpressure
Description:
Use your phones sensors (barometer and compass) to show your current
orientation, height and air pressure.
 
Important:

* Showing height and air pressure only works, if your phone has a built-in barometer (if this is not the case it provides you a simple compass with orientation in degree).

* Calculated height is based on standard atmosphere and can be corrected within the app, if you know your real height.
