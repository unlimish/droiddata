Auto Name:QRStream
Summary:Transfer files and text via successive QR codes.
Description:
QRStream's intent is to provide for communication with a device without using
the radios or USB port.  This can be very useful in a handful of obscure
situations.

The first version of this app sent and received a text file or the clipboard
by calling out to zxing, without a container format or protocol.  Content is
split into reasonable sizes and displayed as QR codes, or QR codes are read
and spliced together in order.  This does allow for compatibility with other
barcode readers and generators.

As (and if) the app develops, some ideas are an optional stream protocol,
embedding the encoding and decoding for smoother use, ensuring binary data can
be transferred reliably, including a data review screen, or providing
forwarding for IP traffic.

If this is useful to you, improve something and send a pull request!
