Auto Name:ScreenCam
Summary:lightweight and functional screen recorder
Description:
ScreenCam doesn't need any root access to record your screen and works on all
phones with Android Lollipop 5.0 and above. You can also record audio along with
the screen recording and get it beautifully combined with the recorded video.

Choose from different resolutions, frames per second and bitrate for the best
choice of quality and size of the video or make use of the app shortcut in
android 7.1 nougat or in any custom launcher supporting app shortcuts.
