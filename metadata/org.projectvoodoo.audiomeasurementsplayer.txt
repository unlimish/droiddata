Auto Name:Voodoo Audio Measurements Player
Summary:Make audio measurements
Description:
Little app that plays RMAA and udial samples to ease Android devices sound
performance measurements.
In order to complete measurements, connect your phone or tablet
headphone/line-out JACK to a computer with
a high quality soundcard line-in then record the output manually.
By using this app instead of playing samples
through a vendor or third-party music player you can be sure no signal
processing is done by the player.

If the manufacturer adds audio effects, youâ€™ll be able to spot them with
confidence through measurement.
Without additional (like SRS, Beats audio) processing and if digital volume is
maxed out, DAC will be fed by un-altered PCM data.

Measurement accuracy tips:
* Ensure any re-sampling is disabled on your computer by setting sample frequencies to 44100 Hz.
* Record using the maximum resolution (in general, 24bit) of your sound card's ADC.
* Run your device on battery, not plugged on charger or USB.
* Take care of using appropriate and consistent input and output levels.
