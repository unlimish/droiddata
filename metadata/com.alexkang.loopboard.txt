Auto Name:LoopBoard
Summary:Record, play and loop sounds
Description:
Dynamic sound board. Record sound clips and play them back or loop them.

Currently, the application can record sounds through the microphone (or
use sounds from internal storage!) and play them back through a newly
created button. Each button has the option to re-record and loop playback.
