Auto Name:CACertMan
Summary:Disable untrusted certificates
Description:
Android 4+ allows you to disable certificates from the system Settings and root
isn't required, so try that first if you want to manually mess with the
certificates. The app won't work with Android 4+ anyway.

An app to manage security certificates on your phone also containing a version
of the Android CACert keystore derived from Mozilla. If a certificate has
recently become untrusted you can either install an update to this app or you
can backup and remove certificates by yourself.

Requires root: Yes, it writes to the system partition. You will need a device
that has the ‘grep’ command on it (via busybox: present on most custom
ROMs). If the ‘save’ doesn’t work, then you will need to make your /system
partition read-write by using a file explorer like [[com.ghostsq.commander]] or
via a command in [[jackpal.androidterm]].
.

Requires Root:yes
