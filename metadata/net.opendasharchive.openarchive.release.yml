AutoName: Save by OpenArchive
Description: |
    Save by OpenArchive enables you to safely preserve, organize, and share your mobile media.
    Designed with and for newsrooms, human rights defenders, and archivists, Save keeps you in control of your mobile media at all times.
    Add metadata and Creative Commons licensing to your audiovisual
    media and then send it to the Internet Archive or any WebDAV server via Tor.
    It offers more agency over your media, while protecting civil liberties and
    increasing interoperability for those interested in finding it and
    reusing it in the future.
