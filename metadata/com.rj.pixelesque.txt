The Pencil tool draws lines, and the eraser removes them. The shapes tool allows
you to use a paint bucket, rectangle, line and circle tools. Two finger drag and
zoom anywhere to navigate large images. Thereâ€™s a full undo/redo stack, as well
as a color picker with history, hsv, rgb, and hex!

The canvas can be resized when a new canvas is chosen. The artwork is licensed
