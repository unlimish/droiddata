AutoName: VirtualXposed
Summary: Use Xposed without root, unlock the bootloader or modify system image
Description: |-
    VirtualXposed is a simple APP based on
    [https://github.com/asLody/VirtualApp VirtualApp] and
    [https://github.com/tiann/epic epic] that allows you to use an Xposed
    Module without needing to root, unlock the bootloader, or flash a custom
    system image. (Supports Android 5.0~9.0.)

    The only two restriction of VirtualXposed are:

    * Unable to modify system, so any Module which modifies system won't be able to work properly.
    * Currently resource hooks are not supported. (Theming modules use Resource Hooks.)
