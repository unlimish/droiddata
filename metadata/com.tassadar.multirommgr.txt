Auto Name:MultiROM Manager
Summary:Manage ROM multiboot
Description:
Switch between different ROMs and systems from the internal memory or external
USB devices via OTG. It uses a modified version of the TWRP recovery.

This app only works on Nexus 7 (2012 & 2013), Nexus 4 and Nexus 5, as they are
the only devices officially supported by MultiROM. It is strongly recommended
that you read the XDA thread for your device before installing this app. Links
are listed below.

MultiROM Manager can install or update MultiROM, its recovery and kernels. It
can also install Ubuntu Touch system-image based builds into MultiROM as a
secondary ROM.
