Auto Name:AnaCam
Summary:Anaglyph Camera
Description:
With this app, you can easily take 3D stereoscopic "anaglyph" pictures
with your device's camera. Simply take two shots at slightly different
locations, and watch the result with red-cyan (or others)
glasses! AnaCam includes a live preview, so that you can find the
best position for the second picture before you take it.
