AutoName: Screenshot Tile (NoRoot)
Summary: Quick settings tile for screenshots
Description: |-
    Adds a button/tile to the quick settings panel to take screenshots.

    After install you need to add the button/tile to your quick settings and
    then grant the permissions to record screen captures and save images to
    the internal storage.

    This is a fork of [https://github.com/ipcjs/ScreenshotTile ScreenshotTile]
    but does not require root. If you have root access, you should use the
    original app, it's faster and more reliant than this fork.
