Auto Name:Mnemododo
Summary:Spaced-repetition learning aid
Description:
Mnemododo allows cards from Mnemosyne (a spaced-repetition flash-card program)
to be reviewed.
Mnemododo does not replace Mnemosyne: cards are still added, edited, and
deleted using a desktop or laptop computer.
Rather, cards for several days are exported using the Mnemogogo plugin and then
transferred to a mobile phone where they can be reviewed on the go.
When those cards have been reviewed, they are imported back into Mnemosyne,
and more cards may be exported.
