Auto Name:Mnemododo
Summary:Spaced-repetition learning aid
Description:
Mnemododo allows cards from Mnemosyne (a spaced-repetition flash-card program)
to be reviewed.

Mnemododo does not replace Mnemosyne: cards are still added, edited, and deleted
using a desktop or laptop computer.

Rather, cards for several days are exported using the Mnemogogo plugin and then
transferred to a mobile phone where they can be reviewed on the go. When those
cards have been reviewed, they are imported back into Mnemosyne, and more cards
may be exported.
