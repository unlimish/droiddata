Summary:Graphical frontend of gogoc for Android
Description:
TSP is a control protocol used to establish and maintain static tunnels.
The Gateway6 client (gogoc) is used on the host computer to connect to a
tunnel broker using the TSP protocol and to get the information for its
tunnel. When it receives the information for the tunnel, the Gateway6
client creates the static tunnel on its operating system.
