Auto Name:Subsonic
Summary:Play media across the network
Description:
Subsonic is both an app and a cross-platform FOSS media server that's capable
of indexing very
large media collections. The server can transcode if necessary so that
the app can play files that your device may not normally support.

There is a demo server provided for giving it a try.
In order to use this app with a Subsonic server beyond a trial period, a key
must be obtained
by making a donation. (A key isn't required to use the
[https://github.com/Mach5/supersonic Supersonic] variant.)
