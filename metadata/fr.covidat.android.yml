Summary: a smart generator for French travel certificates during the Covid-19 containment
Description: |-
    An application that generates French travel certificates (attestation dérogatoire de déplacement)
    that are compulsory during the Covid-19 containment.
    The generated certificates follow the model proposed by the French interior ministry.
    The travel certificate can be generated by hand or automatically by a foreground service
    when one leaves the domestic wifi network.
