Auto Name:Slide
Summary:Minimal presentation tool, perfect for using Takahashi method
Description:
Unlike a typical presentation, only a few words are printed on each slide using
very large characters. To make up for this, a presenter will use many more
slides than in a traditional presentation, each slide being shown for a much
shorter duration.

The slides use plain text in a visual manner, to help the audience quickly read
and understand the material. It's said to be helpful with Japanese and other
eastern languages which use non-Latin alphabets.

The method is designed for the people who are not good at presentations and who
are quite nervous about the idea of presenting. This method helps the presenter
to get organized during the talk and keeps the presenter on track while
presenting. The method provides clear visual support for the audience and helps
make the content more memorable.
