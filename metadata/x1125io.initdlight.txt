Auto Name:Init.d Light
Summary:Add missing init.d support
Description:
This app provides simplest functionality for starting scripts on Android startup
as root.

After installing the App, you'll have to run it at least once for the
BootReceiver to work and for the root access to be granted.

It will also show you where to place your scripts, which is usually
"/data/user/0/x1125io.initdlight/files".

Every script in there will be launched via "su -c [file]".
.
