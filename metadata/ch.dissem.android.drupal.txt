Auto Name:Drupal Editor
Summary:Publish to Drupal based websites
Description:
The Drupal Editor allows you to publish and edit pages on websites using
Drupal. To make it work with your site you have to activate the Blogger
API in your settings. This application is very unofficial, my only ties
to Drupal are me using it for my personal site.
