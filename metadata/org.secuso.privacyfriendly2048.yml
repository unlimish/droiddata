Description: The application Privacy Friendly 2048 is an exciting puzzle game. The

  together. The statistic function is also part of the app. This makes it possible

  achieved number of points. The Privacy Friendly 2048 has four different game modes.

  SECUSO at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
