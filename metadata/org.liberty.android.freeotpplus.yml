AutoName: FreeOTP Plus
Description: |-
    FreeOTP Plus is a fork of FreeOTP provided by Red Hat with the following
    enhancements:

    * Export settings to Google Drive or other document providers
    * Import settings from Google Drive or other document providers
    * Supports Android 6.0 permissions
    * Enhanced UI with material design

    FreeOTP is a two-factor authentication (2FA) application for systems utilizing
    one-time password protocols (OTP). Tokens can be added easily by scanning a
    QR-code or by manually entering in the token configuration.

    FreeOTP implements open standards. This means that no proprietary server-side
    component is necessary: use any server-side component that implements these
    standards â€” for example [http://www.freeipa.org FreeIPA], which uses TOTP. Any
    standards-compliant implementation will work. Currently, FreeOTP provides
    implementations of HOTP (RFC 4226) and TOTP (RFC 6238).
