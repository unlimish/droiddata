Auto Name:Clean Status Bar
Summary:Tidy up your status bar before taking screenshots
Description:
Tired of editing out notifications/low battery to make a nice, clean status bar?
Run this app first - it draws over your status bar, showing only a full battery
and clock.

It runs as a service, so you can swap to other apps to take screenshots.
