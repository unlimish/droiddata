Auto Name:BART Runner
Summary:Timetables for trains in the U.S.
Description:
Enter your most traveled routes and receive a real-time listing of upcoming
departures.

* Streamlined for experienced BART commuters
* Real-time departure info refreshes automatically, and the accuracy of the departure estimates increases over time
* Estimated arrival times
* Pick which train you want to board, and information about that departure will be available in your notification tray
* Set a departure alarm to go off a few minutes before your train leaves (you pick how much advance warning you want)
* Phone will not sleep while viewing departure times (the screen will only dim), so you only need a quick glance at the phone to see how long you have left to catch the train
* Zoomable offline system map
* Fares and next departure time are shown in the saved route listing

There may be an issue with crashes on the Galaxy S: the author is working hard
on a fix.
