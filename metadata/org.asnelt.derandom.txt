Auto Name:Derandom
Summary:Pseudo random number predictor
Description:
Predicts pseudo random numbers based on a sequence of observed numbers.

Enter a sequence of numbers that you obtained from a pseudo random number
generator like, for instance, the Java standard pseudo random number generator
or the Mersenne Twister MT19937. The app will then try to predict following
numbers from the generator.

The app expects all numbers to be entered as integers or floating point numbers
between zero and one. Currently, floating point numbers are supported for the
Mersenne Twister only. Three input modes are supported:

# Text field lets you enter the numbers directly on the device.
# File lets you choose a file with newline separated number strings.
# Socket opens a server socket on the device.

You can then connect with a custom client by means of a client socket and send
newline separated number strings to the server. After each number the server
will send back the next newline separated predictions. Each block of predictions
is separated by an additional newline.
