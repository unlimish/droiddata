Auto Name:RacketGhost
Summary:Ghosting Coach for Squash & Badminton
Description:
Ghosting is an established training exercise in racket sports to practice court
movement without a ball. Moving to the various corners of the court improves
both footwork and general stamina. In the best of worlds, your coach or sparring
partner will always be ready to point you to random corners at a pace that
pushes you to your limits.

Unfortunately, few people have access to a coach at all times, thus have to run
the exercise on their own. That means the randomness in the order of corners is
missing.

Getting Started

1. Configure your ghosting session. 2. Put your mobile device in front of you on
the court. 3. Press "GO!" to start your ghosting session.
