Description:
Generate different passwords from single master password using cryptographically
strong method (PBKDF2 with SHA-256).

Create strong passwords for different websites (or anything else) using a single
secret key. There's no need to remember or store multiple passwords if you can
derive them from your master key.

Ð¡an easily be used as password generator and password manager.

Your passwords doesn't store anywhere, username and url pairs stored for easy
