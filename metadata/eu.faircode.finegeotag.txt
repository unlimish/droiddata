Auto Name:FineGeotag
Summary:Automatically geotag photos
Description:
Automatically geotag photos with a real-time location right after they are
taken. The camera application mostly uses the last known location, which could
be old and miles away from your current position. FineGeotag will try to acquire
an accurate location in real-time and update the Exif location tags of the
photos taken. FineGeotag will try to use the GPS and/or the network location,
depending on which location providers are enabled in the Android settings.
Optionally a popup will be shown with a thumbnail of the photo and the reverse
geocoded address. Don't forget to disable geotagging of your camera application
to prevent interference.
