Summary: A lightweight free & OpenSource Spotify CrossPlatform Client
Description: |-
    Spotube is a Flutter based lightweight spotify client. It utilizes the power of Spotify & Youtube's public API & creates a hazardless, performant & resource friendly User Experience

    Following are the features that currently spotube offers:

    * Open Source
    * Anonymous/Guest Login
    * Cross platform
    * No telemetry, diagnostics or user data collection
    * Lightweight & resource friendly
    * Native performance (Thanks to Flutter+Skia)
    * Playback control is on user's machine instead of server based
    * Small size & less data hungry
    * No spotify or youtube ads since it uses all public & free APIs (But it's recommended to support the creators by watching/liking/subscribing to the artists youtube channel or add as favourite track in spotify. Mostly buying spotify premium is the best way to support their valuable creations)
    * Lyrics
    * Downloadable track
