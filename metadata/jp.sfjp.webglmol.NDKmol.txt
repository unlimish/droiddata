Auto Name:NDKmol
Summary:Molecule viewer
Description:
You can view three dimensional structures of proteins and
small molecules. NDKmol supports most of common representations
for molecules, such as ribbon, trace, stick, sphere and line.
NDKmol also supports symmetry operations; biological assemblies and
crystal packing can be displayed. When launched, NDKMol loads porin
as an example: use your fingers to rotate the view. Search for other
molecules or load pdb files via the sdcard
.
