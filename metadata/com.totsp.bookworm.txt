Auto Name:BookWorm
Summary:Book collection manager
Description:
BookWorm allows you to keep track of books you have read and those you intend to
read. You can enter books by scanning them (if you have
[[com.google.zxing.client.android]] installed), searching for them, or by direct
form entry. You can rate and comment on each book. Once you have your book list,
you can sort and filter it.
