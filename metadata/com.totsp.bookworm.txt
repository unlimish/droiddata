Summary:Book collection manager
Description:

BookWorm allows you to keep track of books you have read and those you
intend to read. You can enter books by scanning them
(if you have [[com.google.zxing.client.android]] installed),
searching for them, or by direct form entry. You can rate and comment on each
book. Once you have your book list, you can sort and filter it.
