Auto Name:build.prop Editor
Summary:Tweak system properties
Description:
Edit your build.prop file easily. This file resides in /system and contains
all the info that identifies the capabilities of your device. After
editing an entry you must press a button in the top right hand corner
that isn't very visible and changes may not register in the list until
you re-enter the app.

Don't mess with this unless you know what you are doing and are confident that
you can restore a backup via adb shell in recovery.

Requires root: Yes. The build.prop is located in /system.
