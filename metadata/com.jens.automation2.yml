    commit: bb22bcee95e3c6cf6c9ba350e1fc7353da51d97b
    subdir: app
    gradle:
      - fdroidFlavor
    scanignore:
      - app/build.gradle

MaintainerNotes: We have to use scanignore because the build.gradle file contains
    the terms firebase and play-services. (But the flavor we build does not actually
    contain those.)
