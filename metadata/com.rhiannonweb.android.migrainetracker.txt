Auto Name:Migraine Tracker
Summary:Event tracker
Description:
Migraine Tracker is a simple event tracking app. Originally designed as a
personal application to track migraines, it can be used to track any recurring
eventâ€™s time and duration for later analysis.

The UI is designed to be as simple as possible, allowing ease of use during
severe headaches or other events where a complex or feature-heavy UI is
unwelcome.

Migraine Tracker does not, and is not intended to, diagnose or treat any
condition. It merely collects data for later analysis by a qualified
professional instead of using paper forms or notebooks. All data is stored
locally on your Android device, and only event duration and score is stored.
