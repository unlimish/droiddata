Auto Name:Lock Screen
Summary:Lock the screen
Description:
This is not a custom "lock screen", but a shortcut to lock the screen.

It is very appreciated for all the people who are afraid to destroy the physical
lock button on their device. Most of them have even a kernel to unlock the phone
without a physical key, and so with this app they will have their little key
save for the eternity.

Features:

* Google Now gesture!
* No other silly feature
.
