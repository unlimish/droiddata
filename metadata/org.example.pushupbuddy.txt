Auto Name:Pushup Buddy
Summary:Count push-ups using sensors
Description:
Uses the proximity sensor of your phone to log your push-up workout.

Press the start button and let Pushup Buddy measure and tell your progress on
your pushup workout, using the proximity sensor. It detects when you rest
between sets and tells you when you have rested long enough and makes a list of
all the sets. Workouts are saved so you can compare them any time.
