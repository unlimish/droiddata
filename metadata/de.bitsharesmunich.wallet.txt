Description:
Cryptocurrency volatility is now a thing of the past. BitShares’ Smartcoins are
tokens that are market-pegged to individual fiat currencies like the Dollar,
Euro, Yuan and assets like Businesses, Gold and Oil. Thousands of investors,
savers, traders and employers now use Smartcoins to buy and sell goods and
services globally.

No bank account? No problem. The unbanked and underbanked can now buy, sell and
use Smartcoins locally with anyone, or utilize one of the many Exchanges who
will convert your fiat into Smartcoins and back again if needed. CCEDK.com,
Poloniex, Bittrex, BTC38 and Yunbi just to name a few.

secure life, liberty and property for all. BitShares software uses the Delegated
Proof Of Stake (DPOS) consensus protocol which cannot be blocked, taken down or
