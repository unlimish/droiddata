Auto Name:Focal
Summary:Advanced camera
Description:
Focal is a fully featured camera app looking to provide the most features on
the most phones possible, including device-specific features on some devices.

*** THIS IS BETA: It has high chances of NOT WORKING PROPERLY - Instead of
rating 1-star because something doesn't work, just WAIT FOR AN UPDATE - This
is FREE! If it doesn't work on your device then REPORT THE BUG, then WAIT AND
SEE -- If you don't want to test it, don't install it. ***

It features:
- A photo and video mode, supporting many features (burst mode, timer mode,
	scene mode, shutter speed on Sony devices, ...)
- A panorama mode, currently semi-broken
- A PicSphere mode, open-source replacement of Google's PhotoSphere, to do
	360Â° sphere shots
- A review drawer, by sliding from the top of the screen (in portrait). It
	shows your latest pictures.

In photo mode, you also have access to a few tools, such as automatic
picture enhancement (auto-awesome), or a rule of thirds overlay. On some
devices, settings such as Color adjustment, HDR and a manual light measure
point are also available. Double tapping the screen will put your in quick
shot mode, where tapping the screen anywhere will take a picture.
In video mode, high-framerate video is also possible.
