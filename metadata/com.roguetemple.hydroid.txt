Auto Name:Hydra Slayer
Summary:Adventure game
Description:
Hydra Slayer is a roguelike game where combat has been inspired by some
mathematical puzzles about brave heroes slaying many headed beasts. This might
look like a standard dungeon crawler, but the puzzle element is important, and
the later game is meant to be challenging.
