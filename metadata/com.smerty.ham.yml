Description: |-
    Solar / calculated band conditions, Maidenhead Grid Locator & Callsign lookups
    via QRZ.com XML subscription. If you have a non-premium (free) account on
    QRZ.com, you will only get the name and country of callsigns. We are looking at
    offering more callsign databases. Many free sources only contain US hams, which
    is of limited use for many users.
