Auto Name:BitcoinSpinner
Summary:Lightweight bitcoin wallet
Description:
'''0.8.3b contains an important 
[http://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2013-08-11-android security fix].''' 
You will need to transfer your coins to another wallet (e.g.
latest version of [[de.schildbach.wallet]]) and uninstall this.
The coins can be moved back to Bitcoinspinner after the 0.8.3b is installed.

Send and receive Bitcoins using QR codes. Share your Bitcoin address using
Gmail, Twitter and more. Backup/restore wallet using QR codes. The blockchain
is not downloaded, but is kept track of by a remote server. All your Bitcoins
are protected using private keys stored on your device using app private storage
. BitcoinSpinner is NOT an on-line Bitcoin Bank. Nobody can run away with your
Bitcoins. It is implemented on top of the BCCAPI, which means that all the heavy
lifting associated with managing the block chain is hosted by a server. The server
side is not in any position to spend your Bitcoins, as all private keys are stored
 in your device. This beta software so don't put the life savings in there.

Anti-features: The app recommends that you use another wallet app 
(its 'successor') but that is published under a non-free license.
