Maintainer Notes:
Upstream runs `gradle assembleFdroid` to generate a floss build. Building with
the "FDroid" flavor within fdroid tries to run assembleFdroidRelease. I don't
know if this is expected gradle behavior or if we make assumptions on our side
that make sense, but don't have to be true.

Quickfix is to introduce the needed task which depends on what upstream runs.
Currently this works fine, but we are not able to pickup the apk file at the
end of the build process.

Disabling AUM until things have been sorted out.
