Auto Name:AcDisplay
Summary:Handle new notifications with ease
Description:
AcDisplay is a new way of handling notifications in Android.
It will let you know about new notifications by showing a minimal, beautiful
screen, allowing you to open them directly from the lock screen. And if you
want to see what's going on, you can simply take your phone out of your pocket
to view all the latest notifications, in a similarly pleasing and minimalistic
manner.

Features:
* Great design and awesome performance.
* Active mode (uses the device's sensors to wake your device up when you need it.)
* Use AcDisplay as your lockscreen.
* Translated to most popular languages.
* Inactive hours (to save some battery.)
* Enable only while charging.
* Lots of other features such as: Blacklist, Dynamic background, Low-priority notifications and much more.
