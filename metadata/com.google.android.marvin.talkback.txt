Auto Name:TalkBack
Summary:Accessibility improvements
Description:
TalkBack is an Accessibility Service that helps blind and vision-impaired
users interact with their devices more easily.
This application adds spoken, audible, and vibration feedback to your device.

It comes pre-installed on many devices
so you won't be able to install this if that is the case.
Developer-built apks can be downloaded from the website if the
version that was pre-installed needs updating.

It's only activated if you explicitly turn on Accessibility:
# Go to Settings
# Select Accessibility
# (Android 3.2 and earlier) Enable Accessibility checkbox
# Enable TalkBack checkboxes
# (Android 4.0 and later) Enable explore-by-touch

See the
[https://eyes-free.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/android_access/index.html FAQ]
or
the [http://eyes-free.blogspot.com Eyes-Free blog] for more on Android accessibility.
