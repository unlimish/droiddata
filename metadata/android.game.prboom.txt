Auto Name:PrBoom For Android
Summary:PrBoom Doom game engine
Description:
PrBoom4Android is a port of the PrBoom Doom engine.

It was originally ported to Android by Vladimir Silva when the
first Android device, the G1, was released. Since the original
port was designed to work with the G1's hardware keyboard, it
did not function with touchscreen only devices. This release
adds on-screen multitouch controls to support newer devices.
If you have a hardware keyboard, you can always use that or
enable the touch controls, the choice is yours!

You will need a WAD file (Doom game data file) to play, you will
be offered to download one of free WAD files by the game on first
run.
