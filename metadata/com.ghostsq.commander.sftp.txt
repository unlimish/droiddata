Auto Name:Ghost Commander - Samba plugin
Summary:Access files on the network
Description:
A plug-in for [[com.ghostsq.commander]] to access to Windows network shared
folders (also referenced as SMB, Samba, CIFS or even NetBios).
Launch Ghost Commander and go to 'Menu > Location > Home > Windows share'.
Alternatively, scroll along the toolbar until you arrive at 'Home'.
Enter your server name and credentials (if any), then tap the 'Connect' button.
Once connected, you should be able to see a list of Windows machines or
Samba servers on the network. Tip: Better have the Windows account with
password. A passwordless Windows account might not work.
