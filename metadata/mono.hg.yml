AutoName: HgLauncher
Description: HgLauncher is a launcher with a design philosophy of 'if it works, it
    works.' Consisting of simply a scrolling list of apps, there is very little visual
    cue to disturb you. If all you want in a launcher is for it to just launch apps
    ASAP, then you may be looking at the right launcher.
