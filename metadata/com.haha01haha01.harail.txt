Auto Name:HaRail
Summary:Find train routes and schedules in Israel
Description:
Lets you find train routes and see schedules for Israel Railways trains. It
is similar to the original Israel Railways app, but with the following
advantages:

1. Simple design for easy and fast searching

2. Searches trains in a local database, making searches very fast and
eliminating the need for internet connection (database needs to be
downloaded once every few months)

3. Searches routes using Dijkstra's algorithm, which can sometimes find
non-trivial routes that are faster.
