Auto Name:Signal
Summary:Communicate securly
Description:
Using Signal, you can communicate instantly while avoiding SMS fees, create
groups so that you can chat in real time with all your friends at once, and
share media or attachments all with complete  privacy. The server never has
access to any of your communication and  never stores any of your data.

- Say Anything: Signal uses an advanced end to end encryption protocol that
provides privacy for every message every time.

- Open Source: Signal is Free and Open Source, enabling anyone to verify its
security by auditing the code. Signal is the only private messenger that uses
open source peer-reviewed cryptographic protocols to keep your messages safe.

- Be Yourself: Signal uses your existing phone number and address book. There
are no separate logins, usernames, passwords, or PINs to manage or lose.

- Group Chat: Signal allows you to create encrypted groups so you can have
private conversations with all your friends at once. Not only are the messages
encrypted, but the Signal server never has access to any group metadata such as
the membership list, group title, or group icon.

- Fast: The Signal protocol is designed to operate in the most constrained
environment possible. Using Signal, messages are instantly delivered to friends.

- Speak Freely: Make crystal-clear phone calls to people who live across town,
or across the ocean, with no long-distance charges.
