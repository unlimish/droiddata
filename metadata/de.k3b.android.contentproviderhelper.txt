Auto Name:Content Provider Helper
Summary:Discover, view and query data of content providers
Description:
This helper is a frontend to query installed content providers. Android's
content providers are similar to database tables.: They have a name (aka
"content:" uri), columns and they can be queried similar to SQL.

Android uses
[https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html
content-providers] as API to manage global accessable data (i.e. images, address
book, text messages, ...).

Forked from  [https://github.com/jenzz/ContentProviderHelper jenzz-s
ContentProviderHelper]  which is not maintained anymore.

App permissions are set generously to provide maximum compatibility.
