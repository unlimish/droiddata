Auto Name:SD Scanner
Summary:Rescan storage media
Description:
Rescan storage media like SD cards for changes. ''SD Scanner'' uses a method
compatible with 4.4 KitKat and 5.0 Lollipop.

In Android 4.4 KitKat, the method used by most older programs to rescan a
storage medium no longer works. Instead, an interface must be used that only
allows one file to be specified at a time. This app works by determining what
files/folders might need to be scanned again, and then by calling the correct
API on each file/folder.

SD Scanner can be used with Tasker by using the "Send Intent" action listed
under "System." Use the following settings, leaving the ones I don't list at the
default:

* Action: android.intent.action.RUN
* Package: com.gmail.jerickson314.sdscanner
* Class: com.gmail.jerickson314.sdscanner.MainActivity
* Target: Activity
.
