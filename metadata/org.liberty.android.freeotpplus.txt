Auto Name:FreeOTP Plus
Summary:Two-factor authentication with import/export functionality
Description:
FreeOTP Plus is a fork of FreeOTP provided by Red Hat with the following
enhancements:

* Export settings to Google Drive or other document providers
* Import settings from Google Drive or other document providers
* Supports Android 6.0 permissions
* Enhanced UI with material design

FreeOTP is a two-factor authentication (2FA) application for systems utilizing
one-time password protocols (OTP). Tokens can be added easily by scanning a
QR-code or by manually entering in the token configuration.

FreeOTP implements open standards. This means that no proprietary server-side
component is necessary: use any server-side component that implements these
standards â€” for example [http://www.freeipa.org FreeIPA], which uses TOTP. Any
standards-compliant implementation will work. Currently, FreeOTP provides
implementations of HOTP (RFC 4226) and TOTP (RFC 6238).
