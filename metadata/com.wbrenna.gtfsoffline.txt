Auto Name:GTFSOffline
Summary:Use with any pro-GTFS transit agency
Description:
Based on <a href="https://github.com/gdmalet/grtransit">GRTransit</a> and substantially
modified (supporting multiple transit agencies, with stripped-down privacy
centric features), this transit app displays bus route and stop information, as
well as bus times (both scheduled and actual expected times), for the Grand
River Transit (GRT) system.

Because of the standardization of the GTFS feed format, many transit initiatives
across the country are releasing open routes in GTFS format. This app allows you
to download a GTFS zip, process it, put it on your phone, and get access to the
stops nearest you, even with multiple bus systems.

YOU must download AND process the GTFS bus/rail schedules YOURSELF! Please refer
to the <a href="https://github.com/wbrenna/GTFSOffline/blob/HEAD/README.md">README</a> for
instructions.
