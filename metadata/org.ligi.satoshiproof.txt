Auto Name:Satoshi Proof
Summary:Prove chronology of events
Description:
Use the Bitcoin network like a notary.
For example if your bike is damaged you can take a photo; then the app
sends a small amount of bitcoins (a Satoshi) to a made-up address. If
you ever need to prove when the photo was taken, the app can do so by
checking the history of the Bitcoin network.
