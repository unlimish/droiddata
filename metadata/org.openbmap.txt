Maintainer Notes:
Upstream is using ant, but building mapsforge from source requires gradle, which fails
on the build server if called in an ant or maven project (or when called multiple times).

The patch migrates upstream's ant build to gradle which includes all dependencies from
mavenCentral. Can be removed if upstream accepts our gradle patches.
