Auto Name:Âµg UnifiedNlp
Summary:Location provider middleware (UnifiedNlp)
Description:
Most modern ROMs come with support for non-Google geolocation providers.
On these systems UnifiedNlp can be installed as a user app to replace
the network location provider. It acts as a middleware for various plugins
aka backends, it does not provide any location lookup itself.

List of backends for geolocation:
* [[org.microg.nlp.backend.apple]] backend that uses Apple's service to resolve wifi locations
* [[org.microg.nlp.backend.openwlanmap]] backend that uses OpenWlanMap.org to resolve user location.
* [[org.gfd.gsmlocation]] Local opencellid based location provider backend
* [[org.fitchfamily.android.gsmlocation]] Local location provider for gsm cells with separate database file (lacells.db)
* [[org.fitchfamily.android.wifi_backend]] Local location provider for WiFi APs using on-phone generated database.

List of backends for (reverse) geocoding:
* [[org.microg.nlp.backend.nominatim]]

After installing a backend, you can use UnifiedNlp by activating network-based
geolocation in Settings->Location. Since KitKat, you need to select any mode
but "device only", on older Android version this setting is called "Wi-Fi &
mobile network location" (ignore any misleading texts saying this is for
Google's location service, you don't have Google's service installed but
UnifiedNlp).

WARNING: Depending on your hardware/software configuration additional steps
might be necessary, please read the [https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp/blob/HEAD/README.md README]
carefully.
