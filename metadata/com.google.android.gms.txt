Auto Name:Âµg UnifiedNlp
Summary:Location provider middleware (UnifiedNlp)
Description:
Most modern ROMs come with support for non-Google geolocation providers.
On these systems UnifiedNlp can be installed as a user app to replace
the network location provider. It acts as a middleware for various plugins
aka backends, it does not provide any location lookup itself.

List of backends for geolocation:
* [[org.microg.nlp.backend.apple]] uses Apple's Wifi database.
* [[org.microg.nlp.backend.openwlanmap]] uses OpenWlanMap.org
* [[org.gfd.gsmlocation]] uses OpenCellId (local)
* [[org.fitchfamily.android.gsmlocation]] uses GSM Celll data (local)
* [[org.fitchfamily.android.wifi_backend]] uses (on-device generated) WiFi data (local)

List of backends for (reverse) geocoding:
* [[org.microg.nlp.backend.nominatim]]

After installing you have to reboot your device and install a backend service,
which has to be activated and configured from the app's settings page. After
this you can use UnifiedNlp by activating network-based geolocation from
Settings -> Location. Since KitKat, you need to select any mode but "device
only", on older Android version this setting is called "Wi-Fi & mobile network
location" (ignore any misleading texts saying this is for Google's location
service, you don't have Google's service installed but UnifiedNlp).

WARNING: Depending on your hardware/software configuration additional steps
might be necessary, please read the [https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp/blob/HEAD/README.md README]
carefully.
