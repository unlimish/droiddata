AutoName: ChartDroid Core
Description: |-
    You don't need to install this unless another app needs it. ChartDroid is an
    Intent-based "library application" for static chart and graph generation on
    Android. Other applications can use it to graph/plot/display numerical data in
    many representations by implementing a ContentProvider.

    ChartDroid is consistent with the "Unix toolkit" philosophy of building small,
    interoperable tools. Having ChartDroid exist as an independent application
    (as against being an importable .jars library) conserves storage space and
    eliminates redundant code.
