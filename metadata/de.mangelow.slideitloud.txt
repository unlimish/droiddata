Summary:Turns on loud speaker if the keyboard is opened
Description:
Automatically turns on the loud speaker if the hardware keyboard is opened
during a call and turns it off if its being closed. Optionally autoanswer and/or
autohangup the same way.

This app is only interesting for users with a slideable physical hardware
keyboard.

The app idea comes from the HTC Wings aka S730.
