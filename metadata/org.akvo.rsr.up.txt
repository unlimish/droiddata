Summary:An easy way to update your Akvo RSR Projects using your Android device.
Description:
Akvo RSR is a web-based platform for providing a visual presence for
development aid projects worldwide. Our trusted partner network provides
project content and updates from the field to paint a descriptive story
of the activities they are carrying out.

Akvo RSR Up is designed to make the process of updating from the field
extremely simple. With a clean and straightforward interface, the user is
guided through the process of selecting their project, viewing existing
updates and adding a new update. With the ability to take a photo directly
from the app, or choose an existing image from the library, it will provide
everything a user needs to keep everyone informed about the latest news and
information on the projects they are working on.
