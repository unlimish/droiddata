Auto Name:Akvo RSR Up
Summary:Manage and update Akvo RSR Projects
Description:
Akvo RSR is a web-based platform for providing a visual presence for development
aid projects worldwide. Our trusted partner network provides project content and
updates from the field to paint a descriptive story of the activities they are
carrying out.

Akvo RSR Up is designed to make the process of updating from the field extremely
simple. With a clean and straightforward interface, the user is guided through
the process of selecting their project, viewing existing updates and adding a
new update. With the ability to take a photo directly from the app, or choose an
existing image from the library, it will provide everything a user needs to keep
everyone informed about the latest news and information on the projects they are
working on.
