Auto Name:Voodoo CarrierIQ Detector
Summary:Check for Carrier IQ spyware on the device
Description:
This is a naive app that tells if your phone seems to host CarrierIQ elements or
not.  CarrierIQ is a diagnostics tool that comes embedded in the firmware of
some Android phones.

Some malware scanners are falsely reporting this as the AndroidOS/Qicsomos.A
trojan.  That trojan requires the android.permission.SEND_SMS permission, this
app does not, so it cannot send SMS messages.
