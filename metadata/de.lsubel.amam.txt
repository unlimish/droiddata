Description:
At the end of the 19th century it was a popular game on social events to answer
a questionnaire. They should help to learn about the interviewee and their
character. The french author Marcel Proust (1871-1922) was one of the most
famous people who answered it
([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proust_Questionnaire Wikipedia]). This
applications allows to get a randomized question from questionnaire, e.g. the
Proust questionnaire, so you can discuss it with another person.
