Auto Name:OneTimePass
Summary:Two-factor (TOTP) authentication
Description:
OneTimePass is a clean and robust two-factor TOTP application and supports the
following features:

* Supports opening otpauth:// URLs
* Scan QR codes to create new accounts easily
* View QR codes to export existing accounts
* Searchable, sortable listing of accounts
* Manual entry account creation
* Import/Export for backup and restore purposes
* Relies upon AES-256 for on-device encryption
* Supports Android 5.0 (and up)

OneTimePass is the reincarnation of the now-retired OneTimePad app. If you used
OneTimePad, you should really migrate to this [or any other TOTP based]
application.
