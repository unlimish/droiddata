Auto Name:Network Tester
Summary:Wifi access point tester
Description:
Is that open wifi really letting you access the web? Android Network Tester quickly validates you're
connected to the real web (by downloading a dedicated 36 bytes file and checking its content). If the
hotspot is actually redirecting you to a billing or authentication portal, you'll know instantly.
