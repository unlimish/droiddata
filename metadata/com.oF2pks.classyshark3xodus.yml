AutoName: ClassyShark3xodus
Summary: Scan apps for trackers
Description: |-
    Checks apps for code signatures of known trackers (provided by Exodus).
    Also can list all classes for launchable (via the app drawer) packages.

    Can be used against any APK:
    * installed: via an app manager,
    * downloaded: via any file manager (long press and open with ClassyShark3xodus),
    * launchable installed: via the first screen list (long press to list all classes, including obfuscated ones).
    Note: doesn't work on odexed/system packages (it's a work-in-progress).

    Finally, the app doesn't sync or connect to the Internet and thus cannot
    sneak on end users.

    The app is updated when Exodus updates their list of trackers:

    ClassyShark3xodus is based on Google's ClassyShark:
