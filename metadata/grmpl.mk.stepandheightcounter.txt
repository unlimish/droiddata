Auto Name:Step and Height counter
Summary:Counting Steps and Elevation gain on Nexus 5X
Description:
This app counts steps and elevation gain if step sensor and pressure sensor is
available as on the Nexus 5X. It is only tested on this device, so I don't know
if it will run on other devices.

Elevation gain should only be counted if steps are detected, so only stairs will
count, but not elevators. Don't expect high accuracy - due to the concept of the
sensors the accuracy is limited. And: avoid walking in trains or subways with
active measurement, as the pressure (and therefore height) will change
significantly during driving.

You can save regular and daily statistics automatically on SD-Card and save a
marker with current values with the floating action button. There isn't much on
graphical display of statistic data, just use any program which can read
csv-values.
