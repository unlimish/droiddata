AutoName: 2048 Open Fun Game
Description: |-
    2048 game with Bookmarks, Auto Replay, History and other fun features, Open Source, no ads.

    How to play.
    Swipe the game board to move all tiles left, right, up, or down.
    When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one with a double number,
    i.e. 2+2 merge into 4, 4+4 merge into 8 and so on.
    The goal is to create a tile with the highest number.
    Number 2048 is a good first winâ€¦
