Auto Name:Voice Notify
Summary:Spoken notifications
Description:
Announces status bar notification messages using Text-To-Speech (TTS), allowing
you to know what a notification says without looking at the screen.

* Customizable TTS message
* Ignore specific apps or notifications containing defined text
* Choice of TTS audio stream (see Google Play descriptions for more details)
* Choice of speaking when screen or headset is on or off, or while silent/vibrate
(Note: Due to API limitations, a headset that is connected when the VN service
starts will need to
be reconnected for VN to see the current state; also all Bluetooth devices are
detected the same, headset or not)
* Quiet Time
* Shake-to-silence
* Custom delay of TTS after notification

For technical reasons, VN operates through Android's Accessibility service and
must be enabled in the Accessibility settings.
The Accessibility service will give a warning that VN may be able to collect
personal data.
This is because Accessibility doesn't know what or how data passing through
it is used by enabled apps.
VN only uses Accessibility to read notification text which is passed directly
to TTS and temporary memory (for the notification log).
The TTS service (outside the control of VN) may also print
spoken text in the logcat.
