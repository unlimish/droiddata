Auto Name:Remembeer
Summary:Rate the beers you drink
Description:
Remembeer lets you track and rate the beers you drink. No more trying
to remember the name of that microbrew from last night, quickly check
your log and see what you thought.

Anti-feature: Network Services. The
Beer Cloud - online database to which the app connects for info -
is neither free-as-in-freedom nor open-source, but that behaviour can
be disabled in the settings
