Summary:A client for (German) public libraries
Description:
VideLibri watches over the books you have lend in public libraries. 
It will automatically renew the loan period, warn you if some books are due,
and keep a history of all ever lend books. 
You can also search new books in the catalog and order the found books. 
It has been tested with over 100 libraries in Germany/Austria/Switzerland.

A custom programming language based on XQuery with pattern matching and 
a corresponding interpreter have been developed for VideLibri, so you can 
add support for any existing library without changing anything in the App 
itself. Due to the pattern matching many libraries can be added by inserting
annotations on downloaded library webpages without writing any source in the
custom programming language, too.

Maintainer Notes:
It is difficult to maintain the dependancies of VideLibri, since most of the
App is not written in Java, but in Pascal.
To compile it you therefore first need to install the FreePascal compiler.
Sadly, its current stable release (2.6) cannnot create android-arm binaries, 
so second you need to download the source of the compiler and compile the 
newest version of the compiler (2.7), which can create these binaries.
Third, you need the source of VideLibri and configure the compiler in fpc.cfg,
such that it can find all .pas files of the source.
Fourth, you need Lazarus, an Pascal IDE with its own component library, on 
which VideLibri depends.
Fifth, you need the android-support-v4, acra-4.5.0 and actionbarsherlock 
libraries.
Sixth, you do the standard Android build process initialization
Seventh, you can hopefully compile everything with a script by calling
"android/manage.sh build", after changing the hard coded paths to the paths 
on your system.
