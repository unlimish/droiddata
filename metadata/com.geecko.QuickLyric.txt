Maintainer Notes:

Next version wil include a jar file, build it with something like:

Build:1.5.8,16
    commit=1.5.7
    forceversion=yes
    forcevercode=yes
    subdir=QuickLyric
    gradle=fdroid
    srclibs=GMusicAPI@5b389d3856372aee3bf7fb3953d74f4c22f62d56
    prebuild=pushd $$GMusicAPI$$ && $$MVN3$$ install -DskipTests && popd && \
             sed -i -e '/mavenCentral/amavenLocal()' -e '/support-v4/acompile "googlemusic:api:googlemusic.api:1.0.0"' build.gradle

Right now installing to mavenLocal seems to be wrong for this jar, so maybe just copy over the jar file.

Re-enable auto updates.
