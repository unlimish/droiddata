Auto Name:Just Search
Summary:Simple Assist app with multiple search providers
Description:
Just Search is an Assist replacement (the app that launches after long pressing
home) and cannot be launched via the launcher. To use it, navigate to the device
settings and change the default Assist app. 

Just Search provides a simple way to search from everywhere without needing to 
launch the heavy (in terms of data and resources' needs) Google search app. Just
Search uses DuckDuckGo by default, but allows opting for a multitude of 
predefined search providers instead. It also allows setting a custom search URL 
so that any search engine is supported.
