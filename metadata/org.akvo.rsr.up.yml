AutoName: Akvo RSR Up
Description: |-
  Akvo RSR is a web-based platform for providing a visual presence for development
  aid projects worldwide. Our trusted partner network provides project content and
  updates from the field to paint a descriptive story of the activities they are
  carrying out.

  Akvo RSR Up is designed to make the process of updating from the field extremely
  simple. With a clean and straightforward interface, the user is guided through
  the process of selecting their project, viewing existing updates and adding a
  new update. With the ability to take a photo directly from the app, or choose an
  existing image from the library, it will provide everything a user needs to keep
  everyone informed about the latest news and information on the projects they are
  working on.
