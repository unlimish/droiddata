AutoName: e-Passport Reader
Description: |-
  Android app that uses the NFC chip to communicate with an electronic passport.
  It supports action, so third party apps can use it to retrieve passport data.
  Please visit website for more information.
  The app is completely open source, so anyone is welcome to validate that it
  doesn't collect any personal information. Data is kept only in memory and
  removed as soon as you close the app. Passport data is never uploaded to any
  remote server.
  App had been successfully tested with Russian passport. It might not work
  with some other passports. If it doesn't work, please create GitHub issue to
  help me fix the issue instead of leaving negative feedback.
