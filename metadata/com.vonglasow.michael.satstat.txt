Auto Name:SatStat
Summary:GPS, sensor and network status
Description:
A diagnostic tool that displays data reported by sensors in the phone.

GPS and other location providers:
* Refresh AGPS data (if supported by phone) either manually, or when a new data connection is detected
* Status notification whenever an app accesses GPS (configurable)
* Location, speed, bearing and error
* Satellites in view and satellites used
* Signal-to-noise ration (SNR) for each satellite
* Time to first fix and time of last fix
* Map view for comparison of different location providers

Sensors (as supported by your phone):
* Accelerometer (acceleration and gravity)
* Rotation
* Magnetic field
* Orientation (azimuth, pitch and roll)
* Ambient temperature
* Pressure
* Relative humidity
* Ambient light
* Proximity

Networks:
* GSM/CDMA/LTE cells in range with network type and signal strength
* WiFi networks in range, with encryption type, channel and signal strength

Known limitations:
* Some phones will report only the network cell with which they are currently registered. On such phones you will only see one cell under "GSM" or "CDMA". This is a limitation of the phone's radio firmware, and SatStat has no way of getting more information from the device.
* Some devices ignore the command to refresh AGPS data. This is a limitation of the GPS driver (which varies from device to device and is usually proprietary). Starting with version 2.0, SatStat has a workaround in place for automatic AGPS updates.

Maintainer Notes:
Build 2.0 switched to gradle because of the dependency on mapsforge, which fails on the build server
if called in an ant or maven project (or when called multiple times). See
https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/issues/58 for details.

Upstream uses ant but maintains build.gradle for F-Droid.
