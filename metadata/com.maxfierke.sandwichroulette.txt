Auto Name:SandwichRoulette
Summary:Random selection of ingredients
Description:
SandwichRoulette is an application designed for the indecisive. Like many
people, my lunch has been delayed because of my inability to decide on what to
put in my sandwiches. This application, designed for Android-powered devices
running 2.1 and higher, automates the ingredient choosing process. Creations can
be saved and later versions will support sharing the particularly delicious
ones.
