Auto Name:SandwichRoulette
Summary:Not sure what you want?
Description:
SandwichRoulette is an application designed for the indecisive. Like many
people, my lunch has been delayed because of my inability to decide on what
to put in my sandwiches. This application, designed for Android-powered
devices running 2.1 and higher, automates the ingredient choosing process.
Creations can be saved and later versions will support sharing the
particularly delicious ones.
