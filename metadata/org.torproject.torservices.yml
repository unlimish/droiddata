Name: TorServices (alpha)
AutoName: TorServices
Description: |-
    TorServices is a free proxy app that empowers other apps to use the
    internet more securely. It acts as a simple Tor "provider" for apps
    to hide their Internet traffic by encrypting it, then bouncing
    through a series of computers around the world. Tor is free software
    and an open network that helps you defend against a form of network
    surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy,
    confidential business activities and relationships, and state
    security known as traffic analysis.

    This app is a compliment to Orbot, which provides the full,
    "batteries included" Tor utility.
