Auto Name:TalkBack
Summary:Accessibility improvements
Description:
TalkBack is an Accessibility Service that helps blind and vision-impaired users
interact with their devices more easily.

This application adds spoken, audible, and vibration feedback to your device.

It comes pre-installed on many devices so you won't be able to install this if
that is the case.

It's only activated if you explicitly turn on Accessibility:

# Go to Settings
# Select Accessibility
# Enable TalkBack checkboxes
.
