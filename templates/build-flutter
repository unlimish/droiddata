    subdir: android/app
    gradle:
      - yes
    output: ../../build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
    srclibs:
      - flutter@1.22.5 ## specify the version you are using
    prebuild:
      - export flutter=$(realpath $$flutter$$)
      - echo "flutter.sdk=$flutter" >> ../local.properties
    build:
      - $$flutter$$/bin/flutter config --no-analytics
      - $$flutter$$/bin/flutter packages pub get
      - $$flutter$$/bin/flutter build apk --release --verbose

It is also possible to build without gradle and notice
how the flavor is parth of the output apk path.

    output: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-fdroid-release.apk
    srclibs:
      - flutter@1.22.2
    build:
      - $$flutter$$/bin/flutter config --no-analytics
      - $$flutter$$/bin/flutter build apk --flavor fdroid


In general grep for "flutter" in the metadata directory to see other examples.
