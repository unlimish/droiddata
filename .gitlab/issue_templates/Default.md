    ======= PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE FILING THE ISSUE =======

    If you are looking to report an app, please check the corresponding metadata first. If the 
    latest version is added and not disabled, then just wait. It takes anywhere from 2-5 days 
    to finish the build & deploy to index/website.

    Metadata are stored in this repo itself. Direct link for a published app's metadata is 
    accessible from the corresponding package's page on f-droid website.

    * https://gitlab.com/fdroid/wiki/-/wikis/FAQ#how-long-does-it-take-for-my-app-to-show-up-on-website-and-client

    Optionally, you can also use a third party app to track build status:
